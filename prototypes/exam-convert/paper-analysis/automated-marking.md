## Question 13a
### Question:
**a) What is meant by the term "standard solution"?** *(1 mark)*

### Handwritten Response:
**A solution with an accurate concentration value.**

### Grading:

A "standard solution" is a solution with a known and precise concentration, often used in titrations and various analytical chemistry techniques.

The student's response, "A solution with an accurate concentration value," is mostly correct. It captures the essence of a standard solution, emphasizing the precision of its concentration.

### Feedback for Improvement:
- **Clarification of "standard solution":** The student could have mentioned that a standard solution has a known concentration, which is specifically prepared for analytical purposes.

### Example answer
A standard solution is a solution with a precisely known concentration, prepared by accurately dissolving a specific mass of a pure solute, which must be free from contaminants and impurities, in a precise volume of solvent.

### Score: **1/1 mark**

The response is accurate enough for full marks, as it conveys the correct idea in a concise manner.

## Question 13b
### OCR Question:
**b) Outline how you would accurately prepare a standard solution of potassium sulfate of concentration 0.268 mol/L.** *(3 marks)*

### Handwritten Response:
**Measure out approximately 46.70436 g of potassium sulfate on a weighing scale and prepare 1 litre of water. Add distilled water into a volumetric flask and fill up with water up to the marked line. Shake the volumetric flask by moving it upside-down and upright repeatedly and add the remaining water. Repeat the shaking process.**

### Grading:

To assess the answer, let's break down the expected steps for preparing a standard solution and then compare them with the student's response:

1. **Calculate the amount of solute needed:** The response correctly indicates "46.70436 g of potassium sulfate," which shows an understanding of molar calculations. This is good.

2. **Weigh the solute:** The student states, "Measure out approximately 46.70436 g of potassium sulfate on a weighing scale." This is correct, although it should be noted that in a practical scenario, the weight might be rounded to a more realistic number, like 46.7 g.

3. **Dissolve the solute in water:** The student instructs to add the potassium sulfate to water. However, the description should specify dissolving the solute in a small amount of distilled water first before transferring to the volumetric flask, which is a standard procedure to ensure complete dissolution.

4. **Transfer to a volumetric flask and dilute to the mark:** The response mentions filling the volumetric flask with water up to the marked line, which is correct.

5. **Mix the solution thoroughly:** The student mentions shaking the volumetric flask by moving it "upside-down and upright repeatedly," which is a proper method for mixing the solution thoroughly.

### Feedback for Improvement:
- **Dissolve the solute first**: The answer would be more precise if it mentioned dissolving the potassium sulfate in a small amount of distilled water before transferring it to the volumetric flask.
- **More concise language**: The student could use more concise scientific terminology to explain the steps.

### Score: **2.5/3 marks**

The response demonstrates a good understanding of the process, with slight inaccuracies in the dissolution step.

### Sample Answer:
To accurately prepare a standard solution of potassium sulfate (\(K_2SO_4\)) with a concentration of 0.268 mol/L, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Mass of \(K_2SO_4\) Needed:**
   - Determine the molar mass of \(K_2SO_4\):
     \[
     K_2SO_4 = (2 \times 39.10) + 32.07 + (4 \times 16.00) = 174.27 \, \text{g/mol}
     \]
   - Calculate the mass of \(K_2SO_4\) required for 1 L of solution:
     \[
     \text{Mass} = \text{Concentration} \times \text{Molar Mass} \times \text{Volume}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Mass} = 0.268 \, \text{mol/L} \times 174.27 \, \text{g/mol} \times 1 \, \text{L} = 46.7 \, \text{g}
     \]

2. **Weigh the Solute:**
   - Use an analytical balance to accurately weigh 46.7 g of pure potassium sulfate (\(K_2SO_4\)). Ensure that the balance is calibrated and that the potassium sulfate is free from moisture and contaminants.

3. **Dissolve the Solute:**
   - Transfer the weighed \(K_2SO_4\) into a clean 1 L volumetric flask using a funnel.
   - Add a small amount of distilled or deionized water to the flask to dissolve the potassium sulfate. Swirl or stir gently until the solute is completely dissolved.

4. **Dilute to the Mark:**
   - After the solute is fully dissolved, carefully add distilled or deionized water to the volumetric flask up to the calibration mark (1 L).
   - Ensure the bottom of the meniscus is exactly at the calibration line when viewed at eye level to ensure precise volume.

5. **Mix the Solution:**
   - Stopper the flask and invert it several times to thoroughly mix the solution, ensuring uniform concentration throughout the flask.

6. **Label the Solution:**
   - Clearly label the flask with the concentration, chemical name, date of preparation, and your initials.

By following these steps, you will have accurately prepared a standard solution of potassium sulfate with a concentration of 0.268 mol/L.

### Question:
**c) Describe how you would use the solution prepared in part (b) above to prepare 100 mL of a solution of potassium sulfate of concentration 0.0268 mol/L.** *(2 marks)*

### Handwritten Response:
**Using a pipette, draw out a sample of the K₂SO₄ solution and add it to a second separate volumetric flask. Fill the volumetric flask up to the 100 mL mark with distilled water and shake the volumetric flask.**

### Grading:

To assess the answer, let's break down the steps needed to prepare a diluted solution from a standard solution and compare them with the student's response:

1. **Measure a specific volume of the original solution using a pipette**: The response correctly states to "use a pipette to draw out a sample of the K₂SO₄ solution," which is appropriate for measuring a precise volume.

2. **Add the measured volume to a new volumetric flask**: The response specifies adding the sample to a "separate volumetric flask," which is correct.

3. **Dilute to the mark with distilled water**: The response mentions filling the flask up to the 100 mL mark with distilled water, which is also correct.

4. **Mix thoroughly**: The student states to shake the volumetric flask, which is a proper method for mixing the solution thoroughly.

### Feedback for Improvement:
- **Specify the volume of the original solution to be pipetted**: For clarity, the student should have specified the exact volume of the original solution to be pipetted out, calculated based on the dilution formula \(C_1V_1 = C_2V_2\). This is important to achieve the desired concentration in the final solution.

### Score: **1.5/2 marks**

The response demonstrates a good understanding of the general dilution process but lacks specific details regarding the volume of the original solution required to achieve the desired concentration.


## Question 15
### Question 15a
### Student response.
Activation energy is the barrier the particles need to overcome in order to successfully react.

If the temperature is low, there’s less energy in the particles, hence only a small proportion of particles are able to react. However, with a high temperature, there’s more energy within particles, and a greater proportion of particles overcome the activation energy barrier.

## Student Part b.
The catalyst will provide an alternate reaction pathway that lowers the activation energy barrier. Hence more particles are able to react, increasing the rate of reaction.

Sample Answers:
A standard solution is a solution with a known concentration, prepared by accurately dissolving a specific mass of solute in a precise volume of solvent, used for quantitative analysis.
