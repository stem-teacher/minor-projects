# Context
I am at a high school where paper science exams need to be marked. Currently it is extremely manual and error prone. Furthermore, measuring statistic about the exam design is impossible due to the expense of marking.

# Solution
Instead like to electronically scan papers (sample attached) and using OCR technology to read the exam and semi-automatically mark the paper. This include:
1. Read the student name
2. Read the class the student is in
3. Identify the students response
4. Compare the student response against the rubric
5. Either indicate that the student was correct or annotate the correct response on the paper.
6. Record in a data file, the student, class, mark and list of questions chosen to allow exam analysis.
7. Provide an interface to allow a manual reader to review the paper and correct any mistakes.
