\chapter{Mixtures and Separation Techniques}

\section{Introduction: Understanding Mixtures}
Every day, we encounter substances that are combinations of many components. The air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat are all examples of \keyword{mixtures}.

A \keyword{mixture} is a combination of two or more substances that are not chemically bonded together. The substances in mixtures retain their individual properties and can be separated using physical methods. In this chapter, we will explore different types of mixtures, why they form, and how scientists and engineers separate them for practical purposes.

\begin{keyconcept}{Pure Substances and Mixtures}
A \keyword{pure substance} contains only one type of particle. Examples include pure water, gold, and oxygen gas (\ce{O2}). A \keyword{mixture}, on the other hand, contains two or more substances physically combined, each retaining its own properties.
\end{keyconcept}

\begin{stopandthink}
Classify the following as pure substances or mixtures: tap water, carbon dioxide gas, air, and sugar crystals.

\section{Types of Mixtures}

\subsection{Homogeneous Mixtures (Solutions)}
In a \keyword{homogeneous mixture}, also known as a \keyword{solution}, the composition is uniform throughout. The particles of the substances are evenly distributed and cannot be distinguished individually.

\begin{example}
Salt dissolved in water forms saltwater, a homogeneous mixture. The salt is evenly distributed, making the salt invisible to the naked eye.
\end{example}

\subsection{Heterogeneous Mixtures}
In a \keyword{heterogeneous mixture}, the composition is not uniform. Different components can be easily distinguished.

\begin{example}
Granola cereal with nuts and dried fruits is a heterogeneous mixture because you can see and separate different ingredients.
\end{example}

\begin{tieredquestions}{Basic}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify which of these is homogeneous: milk, muddy water, vinegar, fruit salad.
    \item Name two homogeneous mixtures you commonly encounter at home.
\end{enumerate}
\end{tieredquestions}

\begin{tieredquestions}{Intermediate}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Explain how you can decide whether a mixture is homogeneous or heterogeneous based on its appearance.
    \item Is air homogeneous or heterogeneous? Provide reasoning.
\end{enumerate}
\end{tieredquestions}

\begin{tieredquestions}{Advanced}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Suggest a method to verify whether a seemingly homogeneous solution is truly homogeneous at a microscopic level.
\end{enumerate}
\end{tieredquestions}

\section{Separation Techniques}
Scientists use various physical techniques to separate mixtures based on particle size, boiling points, solubilities, and other physical properties.

\subsection{Filtration}
Filtration separates solids from liquids or gases by passing a mixture through a barrier with small holes, called a filter, allowing only small particles to pass through.

\label{fig:filtration}
\end{marginfigure}

\begin{investigation}{Separating Sand from Water}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Mix a spoonful of sand in water.
    \item Set up a funnel with filter paper over an empty beaker.
    \item Pour the sand-water mixture slowly through the filter.
    \item Record your observations.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Questions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What substance remains on the filter paper?
    \item What substance passes through the filter?
    \item Why is filtration suitable for this mixture?
\end{itemize}
\end{investigation}

\subsection{Evaporation and Crystallisation}
Evaporation separates a dissolved solid from a solution by heating the liquid until it evaporates, leaving behind crystals of the solid.

\begin{example}
Salt harvesting involves evaporating seawater, leaving salt crystals behind.
\end{example}

\begin{stopandthink}
Why wouldn't filtration work for separating salt dissolved in water?
\end{stopandthink}

\subsection{Distillation}
\keyword{Distillation} separates mixtures based on differences in boiling points. The mixture is heated, and the substance with the lower boiling point evaporates first, then condenses into a separated container.

\begin{historylink}
The ancient Greeks used distillation to create perfumes and essential oils over 2000 years ago.
\end{historylink}

\begin{investigation}{Separating Saltwater by Distillation}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Set up a simple distillation apparatus as demonstrated by your teacher.
    \item Heat the saltwater gently.
    \item Observe the condensation process and collect the distilled water.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Questions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item How does the taste of distilled water differ from the original saltwater?
    \item Explain why distillation is suitable for obtaining pure water.
\end{itemize}
\end{investigation}

\subsection{Chromatography}
\keyword{Chromatography} separates mixtures based on different solubilities and attraction to a stationary phase (e.g., paper).

\begin{keyconcept}{Paper Chromatography}
In \keyword{paper chromatography}, different substances travel at different speeds along paper, separating into distinct bands.
\end{keyconcept}

\begin{investigation}{Colourful Chromatography}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Draw a line with black marker on chromatography paper.
    \item Suspend the paper in a small amount of water, ensuring the line is above water level.
    \item Allow the water to rise, separating the marker colours.
    \item Record your observations of the colour patterns.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Questions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What colours were separated from the original black ink?
    \item Suggest why some colours travel further than others.
\end{itemize}
\end{investigation}

\subsection{Real-world Applications}
Separation techniques are essential in many everyday and industrial processes, such as water purification, mining, food production, and environmental protection.

\end{enumerate}
\end{tieredquestions}

\section{Summary}
Mixtures can be homogeneous or heterogeneous, and their components retain individual properties. Physical separation techniques like filtration, evaporation, distillation, and chromatography exploit these properties. Understanding these methods helps scientists and engineers develop practical solutions to real-world problems, from clean drinking water to resource extraction.
