\chapter{Cells and Body Systems}

\section{Introduction to Cells}

All living things—from tiny bacteria to towering trees and complex animals—are made of cells. Cells are the fundamental building blocks of life, each tiny unit working individually and together to carry out the processes necessary for survival.

\marginnote{\historylink{The term "cell" was first introduced in 1665 by Robert Hooke, who observed cork under a microscope and likened the small compartments he saw to monastery rooms or "cells."}}

In this chapter, we'll explore the fascinating microscopic world of cells, understand differences between plant and animal cells, and discover how cells organize into body systems that keep organisms alive, functioning, and reproducing.

\section{Cell Theory}

Scientists have observed and studied cells for centuries. The collective discoveries led to what we now refer to as the \keyword{cell theory}. Cell theory states three fundamental concepts:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item All living organisms are composed of one or more cells.
    \item The cell is the basic unit of structure and function in organisms.
    \item Cells arise only from pre-existing cells.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{keyconcept}{Cell Theory Essentials}
The cell theory emphasizes the importance of cells as the fundamental unit of life. Understanding cell theory guides biological research and medical advancements.
\end{keyconcept}

\begin{stopandthink}
Why do you think it took scientists hundreds of years to accept the cell theory fully?
\end{stopandthink}

\section{Using Microscopes to Explore Cells}

Cells are microscopic, meaning we cannot see them with the naked eye. Scientists use microscopes to magnify cells and reveal their internal structures.

\subsection{Microscope Basics}

Microscopes work by magnifying the image of small objects. There are different types of microscopes, including compound light microscopes and electron microscopes.

\begin{investigation}{Observing Cells Under the Microscope}
\textbf{Materials:} Microscope, slides, cover slips, onion skin, cheek cells, iodine stain, methylene blue stain.\\
\textbf{Procedure:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Carefully peel a thin layer from an onion.
    \item Place it onto a slide, add a drop of iodine stain, and cover with a cover slip.
    \item Observe under low and then high magnification. Sketch the cells and label structures you see.
    \item Repeat this procedure using your cheek cells stained with methylene blue.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Questions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What differences do you observe between onion and cheek cells?
    \item Why are stains important when observing cells?
\end{itemize}
\end{investigation}

\section{Cell Structure: Plant vs. Animal Cells}

Cells from different organisms vary in shape, size, and structure. The two primary types of cells studied in Stage 4 science are plant and animal cells.

\subsection{Common Cell Structures}

Both plant and animal cells share some common structures:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \keyword{Cell membrane}: Controls entry and exit of substances.
    \item \keyword{Cytoplasm}: Jelly-like fluid in which organelles float.
    \item \keyword{Nucleus}: Controls cell functions, contains DNA.
    \item \keyword{Mitochondria}: Produce energy through respiration.
\end{itemize}

\begin{marginfigure}

\caption{Comparison of plant and animal cells.}
\end{marginfigure}

\subsection{Unique Plant Cell Structures}

Plant cells have unique structures that animal cells do not, including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \keyword{Cell wall}: Provides structure and protection.
    \item \keyword{Chloroplasts}: Contain chlorophyll for photosynthesis.
    \item \keyword{Large vacuole}: Stores water and nutrients.
\end{itemize}

\begin{stopandthink}
Why don't animal cells need cell walls like plant cells do?
\end{stopandthink}

\section{Cells to Systems: Levels of Organization}

In complex organisms, cells are organized into tissues, organs, and systems. Each level has a specialized role, working together to maintain life.

\begin{keyconcept}{Levels of Organization}
Cells $\rightarrow$ Tissues $\rightarrow$ Organs $\rightarrow$ Organ Systems $\rightarrow$ Organism.
\end{keyconcept}

\section{Human Body Systems}

The human body is composed of several interconnected systems. Each system has specialized functions that support life, growth, and reproduction.

\subsection{Digestive System}

The digestive system breaks down food into nutrients that the body can absorb and use.

\begin{marginfigure}
[Placeholder for a diagram of digestive system.]
\caption{The digestive system.}
\end{marginfigure}

Key organs include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \keyword{Mouth}: Mechanical and chemical digestion begin here.
    \item \keyword{Stomach}: Further chemically digests food.
    \item \keyword{Small intestine}: Absorbs nutrients into bloodstream.
    \item \keyword{Large intestine}: Absorbs water, forms feces.
\end{itemize}

\begin{stopandthink}
How is the structure of the small intestine related to its function of absorbing nutrients?
\end{stopandthink}

\subsection{Circulatory System}

The circulatory system transports blood, nutrients, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hormones throughout the body.

\begin{marginfigure}
[Placeholder for a diagram of circulatory system.]
\caption{The circulatory system.}
\end{marginfigure}

Key structures include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \keyword{Heart}: Pumps blood through vessels.
    \item \keyword{Arteries}: Carry blood away from the heart.
    \item \keyword{Veins}: Return blood to the heart.
    \item \keyword{Capillaries}: Facilitate nutrient and gas exchange.
\end{itemize}

\begin{keyconcept}{Structure and Function}
The muscular walls of arteries withstand high pressure from the heart's pumping action, while veins contain valves that prevent blood backflow.
\end{keyconcept}

\subsection{Reproductive System}

The reproductive system produces offspring ensuring species survival.

\begin{marginfigure}
[Placeholder for diagrams of male and female reproductive systems.]
\caption{Human reproductive systems.}
\end{marginfigure}

Major components include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \keyword{Ovaries (female)}: Produce eggs and hormones.
    \item \keyword{Testes (male)}: Produce sperm and hormones.
\end{itemize}

\begin{keyconcept}{Reproduction and Survival}
Reproductive systems ensure genetic diversity and species continuity through sexual reproduction.
\end{keyconcept}

\section{Coordination of Body Systems}

All body systems work together, coordinating their functions to maintain life. This coordination is achieved through chemical (hormones) and electrical (nervous system) signals.
