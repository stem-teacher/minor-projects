\chapter{Mixtures and Separation Techniques}

\section{Introduction}

Look around you. Most of the substances you encounter daily are not pure—they are mixtures. The air you breathe, the seawater you swim in, and even the food you eat are all examples of mixtures. Understanding what mixtures are and how we can separate them into their individual components is essential in science, technology, and everyday life. 

In this chapter, we will explore mixtures, solutions, and pure substances. We will identify several common methods used to separate mixtures, including filtration, distillation, evaporation, and chromatography. Each method will be linked to real-world applications, such as water purification and mining processes.

\section{Mixtures and Pure Substances}

All matter can be classified into two broad categories: pure substances and mixtures.

\begin{keyconcept}{Pure Substances}
A \keyword{pure substance} contains only one type of particle. It can be an element (like gold or oxygen) or a compound (like water or salt).
\end{keyconcept}

\begin{keyconcept}{Mixtures}
A \keyword{mixture} contains two or more substances mixed together physically, not chemically combined. Mixtures can be separated by physical means.
\end{keyconcept}

\marginpar{\historylink{The ancient Greeks, such as Aristotle, believed all matter was a mixture of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire. Modern science has moved beyond this simplistic model, but the concept of matter as mixtures remains relevant.}}

\subsection{Types of Mixtures}

We classify mixtures into two main categories:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Heterogeneous mixtures}: These mixtures don't look the same throughout; you can clearly see different substances. Examples include fruit salad, muddy water, and pizza.
\item \textbf{Homogeneous mixtures (solutions)}: These mixtures have a uniform appearance and composition throughout. Examples include saltwater, soft drinks, and air.
\end{itemize}

\begin{stopandthink}
Classify these examples as either homogeneous or heterogeneous mixtures: tea, cereal in milk, steel, vegetable soup, air.
\end{stopandthink}

\subsection{Solutions}

A common example of a homogeneous mixture is a \keyword{solution}. Solutions are composed of two parts:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Solute}: the substance dissolved.
\item \textbf{Solvent}: the substance that dissolves the solute.
\end{itemize}

For example, in saltwater, salt is the solute and water is the solvent.

\begin{example}
Identify the solute and solvent in the following solutions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sugar dissolved in water.
\item Carbon dioxide gas dissolved in fizzy drinks.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Answer:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sugar (solute), water (solvent).
\item Carbon dioxide (solute), water (solvent).
\end{enumerate}
\end{example}

\section{Separation Techniques}

Since mixtures are physically combined, we can separate them by physical methods. The choice of method depends on the physical properties of the substances in the mixture.

\subsection{Filtration}

\begin{keyconcept}{Filtration}
\keyword{Filtration} separates an undissolved solid from a liquid. It works because the liquid can pass through small holes in the filter paper, while the solid particles cannot.
\end{keyconcept}

\marginpar{\challenge{Can you think of an example of filtration used in your home or school?}}

\begin{investigation}{Separating Sand from Water}
\textbf{Materials}: sand, water, beaker, funnel, filter paper.

\textbf{Procedure}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Mix sand and water in a beaker.
\item Fold filter paper and place it in the funnel.
\item Pour the mixture through the funnel into another beaker.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Observations}: Record what you notice.

\textbf{Questions}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Where is the sand after filtration?
\item Is the water clear after filtration? Explain your observations.
\end{itemize}
\end{investigation}

\subsection{Evaporation}

\begin{keyconcept}{Evaporation}
\keyword{Evaporation} separates a dissolved solid from a solution. By heating the solution, the solvent evaporates, leaving behind solid solute crystals.
\end{keyconcept}

\begin{example}
If you evaporate seawater, salt crystals are left behind. This is how sea salt is harvested commercially.
\end{example}

\begin{stopandthink}
Why can't evaporation be used to separate two liquids?
\end{stopandthink}

\subsection{Distillation}

\begin{keyconcept}{Distillation}
\keyword{Distillation} separates two liquids with different boiling points. The mixture is heated; the liquid with the lower boiling point evaporates first, then condenses and is collected separately.
\end{keyconcept}

\marginpar{\mathlink{Distillation relies on differences in boiling points—water boils at 100°C, while ethanol boils at 78°C.}}

\begin{investigation}{Separating Saltwater Using Distillation}
\textbf{Materials}: saltwater, distillation apparatus (flask, condenser, thermometer, heat source).

\textbf{Procedure}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Heat saltwater gently in the flask.
\item Observe the temperature at which water evaporates and condenses.
\item Collect the distilled water in a separate container.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Observations}: Record your observations and temperatures.

\textbf{Questions}:
\begin{itemize}
\item What substance is left in the flask?
\item Would this method work to separate alcohol and water? Why?
\end{itemize}
\end{investigation}

\subsection{Chromatography}

\begin{keyconcept}{Chromatography}
\keyword{Chromatography} separates mixtures based on how different substances move at different speeds through a stationary phase (often paper) due to their varied solubility in a solvent.
\end{keyconcept}

Chromatography is widely used in forensic science, food testing, and medicine.

\begin{investigation}{Paper Chromatography of Ink}
\textbf{Materials}: chromatography paper, black ink pen, water, beaker.

\textbf{Procedure}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw a small dot with a black pen near the bottom of chromatography paper.
\item Place the paper upright in a beaker with a little water—keep the ink dot above the waterline.
\item Watch as the ink separates into different colours.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Observations}: Record the colours you notice.

\textbf{Questions}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Did the ink separate into more colours than you expected?
\item What could you conclude about black ink?
\end{itemize}
\end{investigation}

\section{Real-world Applications}

\subsection{Water Purification}

Water purification plants use filtration and distillation to provide clean, safe drinking water.

\subsection{Mining and Industry}

Mining operations separate valuable minerals from the earth using techniques like evaporation and filtration.

\section{Summary and Review}

Mixtures are common, and understanding how to separate them is vital in science and everyday life. We explored four main separation techniques—filtration, evaporation, distillation, and chromatography—each based on the physical properties of substances.

\begin{tieredquestions}{Basic}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Define the terms: mixture, pure substance, solution.
\item Give two examples of homogeneous and heterogeneous mixtures.
\end{enumerate}
\end{tieredquestions}

\begin{tieredquestions}{Intermediate}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Explain how filtration separates sand from water.
\item Describe how you would obtain salt from seawater.
\end{enumerate}
\end{tieredquestions}

\begin{tieredquestions}{Advanced}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Explain why distillation is used instead of evaporation to separate alcohol from water.
\item How could chromatography be helpful in identifying suspects in criminal investigations?
\end{enumerate}
\end{tieredquestions}
