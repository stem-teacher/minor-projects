\chapter{Ecosystems and Environmental Science}

\section{Introduction to Ecosystems}

Our planet is home to a vast array of diverse and interconnected ecosystems. From lush rainforests to arid deserts, from freshwater lakes to deep ocean trenches, each of these environments supports unique communities of living organisms interacting with their physical surroundings. These interactions form complex networks that maintain life on Earth. Understanding ecosystems and their dynamics helps us appreciate the delicate balance of our natural world and emphasises our responsibility in preserving it.

\section{Components of an Ecosystem}

An ecosystem comprises both living and non-living components. The living components are known as \keyword{biotic factors}, such as plants, animals, fungi, and bacteria. Non-living components, called \keyword{abiotic factors}, include sunlight, temperature, water, air, and soil.

\subsection{Biotic Factors}

Biotic factors can be categorised into three main groups:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Producers:} Organisms capable of producing their own food through photosynthesis, such as plants and algae.
    \item \textbf{Consumers:} Organisms that cannot produce their own food and rely on other organisms for energy. These include herbivores, carnivores, omnivores, and decomposers.
    \item \textbf{Decomposers:} Organisms such as fungi and bacteria that break down dead organic matter, recycling nutrients back into the ecosystem.
\end{itemize}

\marginnote{\historylink{The term ``ecosystem'' was first introduced in 1935 by British ecologist Arthur Tansley.}}

\begin{stopandthink}
Why are decomposers vital to the sustainability of an ecosystem?
\end{stopandthink}

\subsection{Abiotic Factors}

Abiotic factors significantly influence the type of organisms that can survive in an environment. Key abiotic factors include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sunlight:} Essential for photosynthesis, sunlight availability influences plant growth and distribution.
    \item \textbf{Temperature:} Affects rates of biological processes and determines species distribution.
    \item \textbf{Water:} Availability and quality directly impact organisms' survival, reproduction, and distribution.
    \item \textbf{Soil:} Provides nutrients and habitat for numerous organisms and influences vegetation type.
\end{itemize}

\begin{stopandthink}
Identify two abiotic factors and explain how changes in these factors could impact a grassland ecosystem.
\end{stopandthink}

\begin{tieredquestions}{Basic}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Define \textit{biotic} and \textit{abiotic} factors.
    \item List three examples of each type of factor.
\end{enumerate}
\end{tieredquestions}

\begin{tieredquestions}{Intermediate}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Explain how abiotic factors could limit the distribution of certain plants.
    \item Describe the importance of decomposers in the cycling of nutrients.
\end{enumerate}
\end{tieredquestions}

\begin{tieredquestions}{Advanced}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Predict and explain how the removal of producers might affect an ecosystem.
    \item Discuss the interdependence between biotic and abiotic factors using a rainforest ecosystem as an example.
\end{enumerate}
\end{tieredquestions}

\section{Energy Flow in Ecosystems}

All ecosystems require energy to sustain life. The primary source of energy for most ecosystems is sunlight, entering through the process of photosynthesis.

\subsection{Food Chains and Food Webs}

Energy flows through ecosystems via \keyword{food chains}, sequences of organisms each dependent on the previous as a source of food. At the base of every food chain are producers, followed by primary consumers (herbivores), secondary consumers (carnivores), and tertiary consumers (apex predators).

However, most organisms are part of complex interconnected food chains, forming a \keyword{food web}. This interconnectedness provides stability to ecosystems.

\marginnote{\challenge{Consider what might happen if a top predator is removed from a food web. How would this affect other organisms?}}

\begin{keyconcept}{Energy Transfer Efficiency}
Energy transfer between trophic levels is inefficient. Typically, only about 10\% of energy at one trophic level is passed onto the next. The remaining 90\% is lost as heat or used for metabolic processes.
\end{keyconcept}

\begin{stopandthink}
If producers capture 10,000 units of energy, how much energy is available to secondary consumers?
\end{stopandthink}

\begin{investigation}{Constructing a Food Web}
\textbf{Aim:} To construct a food web based on organisms found in your local environment.

\textbf{Materials:} Research resources, paper, coloured markers.

\textbf{Method:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify and list 10 organisms from your local ecosystem including producers, consumers, and decomposers.
    \item Research feeding relationships among these organisms.
    \item Construct a food web, illustrating these relationships.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Discussion:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify producers, primary consumers, secondary consumers, and decomposers in your food web.
    \item Discuss how removing one organism might affect others.
\end{enumerate}
\end{investigation}

\section{Cycles of Matter}

Unlike energy, matter is continuously recycled within ecosystems. Three significant cycles include the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle.

\subsection{Water Cycle}

Water moves continuously through the environment via evaporation, condensation, precipitation, runoff, and transpiration.

\subsection{Carbon Cycle}

Carbon cycles through ecosystems via photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition, fossilisation, and combustion. Carbon dioxide (\ce{CO2}) levels have a significant impact on global climate.

\subsection{Nitrogen Cycle}

Nitrogen is essential for living organisms as it is a key component of amino acids and DNA. Nitrogen cycles through processes such as nitrogen fixation, nitrification, assimilation, ammonification, and denitrification.

\marginnote{\keyword{Nitrogen fixation}â€”conversion of atmospheric nitrogen (\ce{N2}) into usable forms like ammonia (\ce{NH3}).}

\begin{tieredquestions}{Basic}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item List the major processes in the water cycle.
    \item Explain why carbon is important to living organisms.
\end{enumerate}
\end{tieredquestions}

\begin{tieredquestions}{Intermediate}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Describe human activities that influence the carbon cycle.
    \item Explain the role bacteria play in the nitrogen cycle.
\end{enumerate}
\end{tieredquestions}

\begin{tieredquestions}{Advanced}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Evaluate how changes in the carbon cycle could affect climate globally.
    \item Analyse how agricultural practices can disrupt the nitrogen cycle.
\end{enumerate}
\end{tieredquestions}

\section{Human Impact on Ecosystems}

Human activities significantly impact ecosystems, often causing harm through pollution, deforestation, habitat destruction, invasive species, and overexploitation of resources.

\marginnote{\historylink{The Industrial Revolution in the 18th century marked increased fossil fuel combustion, significantly altering the carbon cycle.}}

\subsection{Pollution and Environmental Change}

Pollution of air, water, and soil has detrimental effects on ecosystems. For example, nutrient pollution can lead to eutrophication, causing severe disruption in freshwater ecosystems.

\begin{investigation}{Water Quality Testing}
\textbf{Aim:} To investigate the water quality of a local water body.

\textbf{Materials:} Water test kit, notebook, camera.

\textbf{Method:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Choose a local stream or pond.
    \item Collect water samples, testing for indicators such as pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrates, and phosphates.
    \item Record observations of wildlife and plant life.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Discussion:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Interpret your results to assess the water body's health.
    \item Suggest actions to improve or maintain water quality.
\end{enumerate}
