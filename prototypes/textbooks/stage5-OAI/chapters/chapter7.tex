\chapter{Chemical Reactions and Equations}

Chemical reactions are fundamental to understanding the natural and human-made world around us. From the digestion of food in your body to the combustion of fuel in a carâ€™s engine, chemical reactions occur constantly. In this chapter, you will explore the nature of chemical reactions, how scientists represent these reactions using chemical equations, and the principles that govern these processes. By investigating reactions in the laboratory and exploring everyday examples, you'll develop a deeper understanding of chemistry's role in our lives.

\section{What is a Chemical Reaction?}

Every substance around us is made of atoms, the tiny particles that form all matter. A chemical reaction occurs when atoms rearrange themselves to form new substances. During a chemical reaction, chemical bonds between atoms break, and new bonds form, resulting in entirely different substances with distinctive properties.

\begin{keyconcept}{Chemical Reaction}
A \keyword{chemical reaction} is a process in which substances (reactants) change into new substances (products) through the rearrangement of atoms.
\end{keyconcept}

\subsection{Identifying Chemical Reactions}

Chemical reactions often have observable signs. Some typical indicators include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Colour change
    \item Formation of a precipitate (solid)
    \item Gas production (bubbles or fizzing)
    \item Temperature change (heat absorbed or released)
    \item Change in odour
\end{itemize}

However, not all these signs must be present for a reaction to occur.

\begin{stopandthink}
When you cook an egg, it changes colour and texture. Is cooking an egg a chemical reaction? Explain your reasoning.
\end{stopandthink}

\begin{investigation}{Observing Chemical Change}
\textbf{Aim:} To identify evidence of chemical reactions.

\textbf{Materials:} Copper sulfate solution (\ce{CuSO4}), iron nails, hydrochloric acid (\ce{HCl}), calcium carbonate (\ce{CaCO3}), thermometer, safety goggles, test tubes.

\textbf{Method:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Add an iron nail into copper sulfate solution and leave for 10 minutes. Observe any changes.
    \item Add hydrochloric acid to calcium carbonate in a test tube. Note your observations carefully.
    \item Measure temperature changes in both reactions.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Questions:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item List all evidence that chemical reactions took place.
    \item Which reaction showed temperature change? Explain why this occurred.
\end{enumerate}

\end{investigation}

\begin{tieredquestions}{Basic}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Define a chemical reaction in your own words.
    \item Name three observations that indicate a chemical reaction is occurring.
\end{enumerate}
\end{tieredquestions}

\begin{tieredquestions}{Intermediate}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Explain why a physical change (such as melting ice) is different from a chemical reaction.
    \item Identify which of these events are chemical reactions: rusting iron, dissolving sugar, burning wood, evaporating water. Justify your answers.
\end{enumerate}
\end{tieredquestions}

\begin{tieredquestions}{Advanced}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Explain, at an atomic level, what happens during a chemical reaction.
    \item Research and describe an example of a chemical reaction that occurs in everyday life, highlighting its usefulness.
\end{enumerate}
\end{tieredquestions}

\section{Chemical Equations}

Chemists use chemical equations to represent chemical reactions clearly and concisely. A chemical equation shows the reactants (substances at the start of a reaction) on the left-hand side and the products (substances formed) on the right-hand side, separated by an arrow (\(\rightarrow\)).

\begin{example}
When hydrogen gas reacts with oxygen gas, water is produced:
\[
\ce{2H2 (g) + O2 (g) -> 2H2O (l)}
\]
\end{example}

\marginnote{\keyword{Reactants} are substances before reaction; \keyword{Products} are substances after reaction.}

\subsection{Balancing Chemical Equations}

According to the law of conservation of mass, atoms are neither created nor destroyed during a chemical reaction. Therefore, a chemical equation must have the same number of atoms of each element on both sides. We balance equations by placing whole-number coefficients in front of chemical formulas.

\begin{keyconcept}{Law of Conservation of Mass}
In a chemical reaction, the total mass of the reactants is always equal to the total mass of the products.
\end{keyconcept}

\begin{example}
Balance the chemical equation:
\[
\ce{CH4 + O2 -> CO2 + H2O}
\]

\textbf{Solution:}

First, count atoms on each side:

\begin{tabular}{l c c}
 & Reactants & Products\\
C & 1 & 1 \\
H & 4 & 2 \\
O & 2 & 3 \\
\end{tabular}

Balance hydrogen by placing a 2 before water:

\[
\ce{CH4 + O2 -> CO2 + 2H2O}
\]

Now recount atoms:

\begin{tabular}{l c c}
 & Reactants & Products\\
C & 1 & 1 \\
H & 4 & 4 \\
O & 2 & 4 \\
\end{tabular}

Balance oxygen by placing a 2 before oxygen gas:

\[
\ce{CH4 + 2O2 -> CO2 + 2H2O}
\]

The equation is now balanced.
\end{example}

\begin{stopandthink}
Why must chemical equations be balanced? What does it represent about the atoms involved in the reaction?
\end{stopandthink}

\begin{tieredquestions}{Basic}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Balance the equation: \(\ce{Na + Cl2 -> NaCl}\)
    \item Identify reactants and products in the above reaction.
\end{enumerate}
\end{tieredquestions}

\begin{tieredquestions}{Intermediate}
Balance these equations:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \(\ce{C2H6 + O2 -> CO2 + H2O}\)
    \item \(\ce{Fe + O2 -> Fe2O3}\)
\end{enumerate}
\end{tieredquestions}

\begin{tieredquestions}{Advanced}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Explain why fractional coefficients are not used in balanced chemical equations.
    \item Balance the following equation and explain your process clearly:
    \[
    \ce{Al + HCl -> AlCl3 + H2}
    \]
\end{enumerate}
\end{tieredquestions}

\section{Types of Chemical Reactions}

Chemical reactions can be categorised into several common types. Understanding these types helps chemists predict products and outcomes. Common reaction types include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Synthesis (combination) reactions
    \item Decomposition reactions
    \item Single displacement reactions
    \item Double displacement reactions
    \item Combustion reactions
\end{itemize}
