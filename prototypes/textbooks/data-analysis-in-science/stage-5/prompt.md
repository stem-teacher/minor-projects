New AI Session Prompt:

"You are now an expert curriculum developer tasked with creating a 10-week Data Science program for Year 10 students (ages 15-16) in a selective school. This program, designated as Stage 5 Data Science 2, must be fully aligned with the NSW Stage 5 Science Syllabus and the Australian Curriculum: Science (Version 8.4), specifically focusing on the 'Data Science 2' content area as detailed in the provided document: 'Science 7-10: Data Science Guide and Scope & Sequence'.

The program should build upon the pedagogical principles established in a previously developed Stage 4 Data Science program. These principles include a strong emphasis on:

Hands-on Learning: Activities that actively engage students in data science processes.
Scientific Inquiry: Fostering a question-driven, investigative approach to data.
Data Representation and Visualization: Developing skills in presenting data effectively.
Numeracy Skills: Reinforcing and applying mathematical concepts within data science contexts.
Integration of Digital Tools: Centrally utilize the Observable Open-Source Framework and incorporate AI-driven assessments and feedback mechanisms.
Real-World Analysis: Focus on analyzing data relevant to real-world scientific and societal problems, using modern data science tools and techniques.
Your deliverables for this Stage 5 Data Science 2 curriculum are comprehensive and should mirror the structure and detail of the Stage 4 program. Please provide:

Course Plan: A detailed 10-week schedule outlining topics, learning objectives for each week, and clear alignment with the NSW Stage 5 Science Syllabus and the Australian Curriculum.
Lesson Plans: Detailed lesson plans for each of the three weekly classes (total 30 lessons across 10 weeks). Each lesson plan should include:
Title & Learning Outcomes: Clearly stated, NSW Curriculum-aligned learning outcomes.
Overview: A concise description of the lesson's purpose and connection to data science and scientific inquiry.
Activities: Detailed activities, including:
Warm-up exercises.
Main activities (hands-on experiments, group work, Observable framework utilization, Python-based data science exercises in AI-assisted notebooks).
Reflection and Discussion prompts.
Assessments: Formative assessment strategies (quizzes, AI-generated questions, in-class tasks).
Student Workbook Elements: Outline workbook exercises, particularly those using Observable interactive notebooks.
Extension Activities: Additional challenging activities for advanced learners.
Lesson Materials: Outline the required lesson materials:
Slide Decks (visual presentations).
Handouts and Notes (supplementary material).
Online Workbooks (developed in Observable for live data manipulation and visualization).
Python-Based Exercises (integrated within AI-assisted notebooks).
Automated Assessments: Detail the automated assessment strategy:
Summative Assessments (AI-generated multiple-choice and open-ended questions, real-world data application tasks).
Interactive Review Sessions (AI-powered feedback mechanisms).
End-of-Semester Exam: Describe the format and grading of the End-of-Semester Exam:
Format: Data analysis tasks, graph interpretation, real-world problem simulations.
Grading: Automated grading using AI and Observable workbooks.
AI Integration: Detail the planned AI integration components:
AI Assistant: Voice and chat interfaces for student support and problem-solving guidance.
AI Review System: Automated analysis of student submissions with detailed feedback.
Study Summaries: Weekly AI-generated recaps for student revision.
Crucially, ensure the curriculum content and learning outcomes are directly and accurately aligned with the 'Data Science 2' section of the provided 'Science 7-10: Data Science Guide and Scope & Sequence' document. Pay close attention to the specified content points for Stage 5 Data Science 2.

Maintain a detailed, structured, and practical approach, providing a comprehensive and ready-to-implement curriculum for Year 10 Data Science 2, similar in quality and depth to the previously created Stage 4 program."
