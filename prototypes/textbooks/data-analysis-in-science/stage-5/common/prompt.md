Okay, please consider this prompt for a new AI session to create the Stage 5 Data Science program:

**New AI Session Prompt:**

"You are now an expert curriculum developer tasked with creating a 10-week Data Science program for Year 10 students (ages 15-16) in a selective school. This program, designated as **Stage 5 Data Science 2**, must be fully aligned with the NSW Stage 5 Science Syllabus and the Australian Curriculum: Science (Version 8.4), specifically focusing on the 'Data Science 2' content area as detailed in the provided document: 'Science 7-10: Data Science Guide and Scope & Sequence'.

The program should build upon the pedagogical principles established in a previously developed Stage 4 Data Science program.  These principles include a strong emphasis on:

*   **Hands-on Learning:** Activities that actively engage students in data science processes.
*   **Scientific Inquiry:**  Fostering a question-driven, investigative approach to data.
*   **Data Representation and Visualization:**  Developing skills in presenting data effectively.
*   **Numeracy Skills:**  Reinforcing and applying mathematical concepts within data science contexts.
*   **Integration of Digital Tools:**  Centrally utilize the Observable Open-Source Framework and incorporate AI-driven assessments and feedback mechanisms.
*   **Real-World Analysis:**  Focus on analyzing data relevant to real-world scientific and societal problems, using modern data science tools and techniques.

Your deliverables for this Stage 5 Data Science 2 curriculum are comprehensive and should mirror the structure and detail of the Stage 4 program.  Please provide:

1.  **Course Plan:** A detailed 10-week schedule outlining topics, learning objectives for each week, and clear alignment with the NSW Stage 5 Science Syllabus and the Australian Curriculum.

2.  **Lesson Plans:**  Detailed lesson plans for each of the three weekly classes (total 30 lessons across 10 weeks). Each lesson plan should include:
    *   **Title & Learning Outcomes:** Clearly stated, NSW Curriculum-aligned learning outcomes.
    *   **Overview:** A concise description of the lesson's purpose and connection to data science and scientific inquiry.
    *   **Activities:**  Detailed activities, including:
        *   Warm-up exercises.
        *   Main activities (hands-on experiments, group work, Observable framework utilization, Python-based data science exercises in AI-assisted notebooks).
        *   Reflection and Discussion prompts.
    *   **Assessments:** Formative assessment strategies (quizzes, AI-generated questions, in-class tasks).
    *   **Student Workbook Elements:**  Outline workbook exercises, particularly those using Observable interactive notebooks.
    *   **Extension Activities:**  Additional challenging activities for advanced learners.

3.  **Lesson Materials:**  Outline the required lesson materials:
    *   Slide Decks (visual presentations).
    *   Handouts and Notes (supplementary material).
    *   Online Workbooks (developed in Observable for live data manipulation and visualization).
    *   Python-Based Exercises (integrated within AI-assisted notebooks).

4.  **Automated Assessments:** Detail the automated assessment strategy:
    *   Summative Assessments (AI-generated multiple-choice and open-ended questions, real-world data application tasks).
    *   Interactive Review Sessions (AI-powered feedback mechanisms).

5.  **End-of-Semester Exam:** Describe the format and grading of the End-of-Semester Exam:
    *   Format: Data analysis tasks, graph interpretation, real-world problem simulations.
    *   Grading: Automated grading using AI and Observable workbooks.

6.  **AI Integration:** Detail the planned AI integration components:
    *   AI Assistant: Voice and chat interfaces for student support and problem-solving guidance.
    *   AI Review System: Automated analysis of student submissions with detailed feedback.
    *   Study Summaries: Weekly AI-generated recaps for student revision.

Crucially, ensure the curriculum content and learning outcomes are directly and accurately aligned with the **'Data Science 2'** section of the provided 'Science 7-10: Data Science Guide and Scope & Sequence' document.  Pay close attention to the specified content points for Stage 5 Data Science 2.

Maintain a detailed, structured, and practical approach, providing a comprehensive and ready-to-implement curriculum for Year 10 Data Science 2, similar in quality and depth to the previously created Stage 4 program."

## Purpose

The Science 7-10: Data science guide is designed to support the teaching of the *Science 7-10 Syllabus* (2023). It is intended to convey information, resources, teaching advice and conventions relating to data science.

Data science is the process of analysing data from investigations in order to identify connections and trends which can be used to make informed predictions.

## Data Science Cycle

The data science cycle involves 5 key steps:

1. **Questioning:** The process begins with a question related to an area of interest or a problem that needs solving.

2. **Collecting data:** In Stage 4, data might be collected as a class from an experiment or investigation.

3. **Processing data:** Collected data is organised so that it makes sense.

4. **Analysing data:** The data is examined closely to find answers to the original question.

5. **Communicating:** The final step is to communicate the findings.



## Data Science 1

The Data science 1 focus area can be taught alongside other focus areas, and aligned to students' interests, local contexts or the school environment.
