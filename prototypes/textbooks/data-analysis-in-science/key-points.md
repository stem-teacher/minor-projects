Data quality and integrity
When teaching students about data representations, it is important to consider the quality and the integrity of the data used to form the representation.
To ensure accurate and meaningful data representation and analysis, the following should be considered.
Accuracy
Data should be correct and free of errors. Students should understand the importance of verifying that the data they are using, or the representation they are interpreting, accurately reflects findings and has not been altered or misrecorded.
Data accuracy includes considerations of data completeness. Students should check that datasets are complete and be aware of the impact of missing values. When generating their own data representations, students should present data in a way that avoids distortion or misleading interpretations.
Bias and objectivity
Students should be aware of and address potential biases in data collection or analysis and ensure that the data is presented objectively.
Consistency
Data should be consistent across sources or formats to allow for accurate representations. Mismatched units of measurement will result in flawed data representations.
Data privacy
Integrity also involves ethical considerations. If applicable, students may explore the importance of data privacy and ethical considerations when working with sensitive information.
Data validation
Students should evaluate the reliability and credibility of the data source to ensure accuracy. Reliable data comes from credible, accurate and unbiased sources.
Identifying anomalies
Students need to be able to recognise and address unexpected or inconsistent data points.


To support a consistent approach to data across the 7–10 curriculum, the most common methods of presenting data displays and statistical measures are listed below.
 
Data displays
	Table
	Pictogram
	Column graph (and bar graph)
	Multiple (or side-by-side) column graph
	Compound column graph
	Sector graph
	Dot map
	Line graph
	Scatter plot
	Box plot
	Infographic
Statistical measures
	Mean
	Median
	Mode
	Range
	Standard deviation


# Teaching Numeracy - Years 7-10

Data Science 1
Unit: How can data be manipulated?
Focus area: Data Science 1
Students broaden their understanding of how data is used in science, including in the development of scientific models (for example, predicting movement of celestial objects and weather patterns). They build on their problem-solving skills by proposing solutions and recognising data that supports or refutes identified predictions. Students explore diverse data sources and their practical uses, ranging from experimental and big data to digital technology. By recognising the significance of responsible online engagement, students learn to assess the digital footprint generated by various online activities. They learn that data science integrates statistics, scientific methods, algorithms and systems to extract insights from data. Students study scientific models, recognising them as representations of real-world phenomena. They identify model types utilised by scientists, assess data, and make predictions. Students explore data-driven processes, formulate investigable questions and analyse data for patterns. Through this content, students develop skills in creating models to explain observable phenomena, enabling them to engage critically with data and scientific representation.
