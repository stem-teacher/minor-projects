I am looking to prepare a 10 week teaching sequence for year 8 students in data science at a NSW selective school. I have attached the relevant NSW School Curriculum (# Curriculum Overview: Data science 1). Using the attached files as input (and control in the case of curriculum), in the first instance I am looking to create a complete AI prompt to assist with the generation of:
The program Plan
Lesson Plans (example attached test-lesson-plan.md)
Class Room Lessons

To support simplicity of teaching and ensuring students have access to state of the art learning environments, I am looking to ensure, where relevant, each lesson has a supporting data science workbook, developed using workbook style visualisaton.

Data science visualisations should be influenced by the work of Edward Tufte including his book "Beautiful Evidence" 2006.

Thus the different required elements of the site should be defined.
As the courses are developed, the areas of numeric literacy framework. There needs to be formative assessment of the students literacy levels.

Draft Prompt follows.

## Goal:
Curriculum compliant (# Curriculum Overview: Data science 1) 10 week Year 8 Data Science Program including:
a) Program plan
b) Lesson plan
c) Lessons with support for summative assessment & handouts
d) End semester exams
e) Interactive AI tutor as well as supporting set of online workbook
f) AI material review

## Background
The following is an overview & outline of Year 8 Science program (13-14 YO) on Data Science at a NSW selective school.
The subject is run over 10 weeks, 3 times a week in 1 hour classes.
Given not all classes will be available, assume there are 25 hours available in practice.

### Values
The course should have a very strong theme of data supported evidence. It is through evidence approach that science differs from other disciplines:

  "If you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it.” “When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind" - Lord Kelvin

Visual representation of data has value.

## Elements

The program should start with an introduction and overview.

During the program, students should start with a basic measure of entities to ensure exellent physical understanding  of measurement, basic data collecting, and key data analysis.

Then start ensuring students have an excellent understanding of accuracy, precision, validity. These concepts needs to be drilled.

So in practice, this all paper & calculator based.

However, Real data science is  tool supported, thus students need to build up a set of expertise over the 10 weeks. Given the age - there should be a little spreadsheet use, but should quickly use workbooks - and in this context built using workbook markdown.

The lesson is designed to be interactive and challenging for selective students, emphasizing critical thinking and practical application.
*   **Activities:**
    *   **Warm-Up (10 mins):** "Accuracy vs. Precision Challenge" -  Use physical examples or visual aids (targets, diagrams) to quickly review the difference between accuracy and precision.  Pose quick questions: "Which is more important in measuring the length of a critical component for a rocket: accuracy or precision?" "If you are repeatedly weighing samples of a chemical in an experiment, and all your measurements are very close together, but consistently slightly off the known mass, is your measurement precise or accurate or both or neither?" Class discussion to reinforce definitions.
    *   **Main Activity 1: "Measurement Olympics" (30 mins):** (Hands-on, stations-based activity)
        *   Set up different measurement stations around the classroom. Each station focuses on measuring a different physical quantity using different tools and methods. Examples:
            *   **Station 1: Length Measurement:** Measure the length of a complex object (e.g., a curved object, irregular shape) using rulers, measuring tapes, and potentially digital calipers (if available).
            *   **Station 2: Mass Measurement:** Measure the mass of several objects using different types of balances (e.g., electronic balance, triple beam balance). Include objects with slightly varying masses.
            *   **Station 3: Volume Measurement:** Measure the volume of liquids using graduated cylinders, beakers, and pipettes.  Emphasize reading meniscus correctly.
            *   **Station 4: Time Measurement:** Measure the time for a simple event to occur repeatedly (e.g., pendulum swing, ball rolling down a ramp) using stopwatches (potentially digital stopwatches).
        *   Students rotate through stations in small groups. At each station, they:
            *   Take *multiple* measurements of the same quantity using the assigned tools/methods.
            *   Record all measurements.
            *   Calculate the average and range of their measurements at each station.
        *   Class discussion after "Olympics":
            *   At which stations were measurements most precise? Least precise? Why?
            *   How could you improve precision at each station?
            *   Were there any measurements that you suspect were inaccurate? How would you check for accuracy?
    *   **Main Activity 2: "Validity Challenge: Designing a Valid Experiment" (20 mins):**
        *   Introduce the concept of Validity: Are we measuring what we intend to measure? Is our experiment designed to answer our scientific question without bias or confounding factors?
        *   Present a flawed experimental design scenario (related to a topic students are familiar with or from a previous lesson, e.g., investigating plant growth and sunlight, or reaction time and caffeine).  The scenario should have clear flaws that affect validity (e.g., uncontrolled variables, biased sampling, lack of control group, unclear procedure).
        *   In groups, students analyse the flawed experimental design and:
            *   Identify specific threats to validity in the design.
            *   Propose *specific* improvements to the experimental design to increase its validity (e.g., how to control variables, improve randomization, add a control group, refine procedure).
        *   Groups share their analysis and proposed improvements. Class discussion on strategies for ensuring validity in experimental design.
    *   **Reflection & Discussion (10 mins):** Class discussion:
        *   Why are accuracy, precision, and validity all essential for high-quality scientific data?
        *   What are some practical steps scientists can take to maximize accuracy, precision, and validity in their research?
        *   How does understanding these concepts help you become a better data scientist and scientific investigator?
    *   **Assessments:**
        *   Formative Task (5 mins): "Accuracy, Precision, Validity Definitions" - Students write brief definitions of accuracy, precision, and validity in their own words.
        *   Observation of student engagement in "Measurement Olympics" and "Validity Challenge" activities, assessing their understanding of the concepts through their actions and discussions.
    *   **Student Workbook:**
        *   Definitions of accuracy, precision, and validity with examples.
        *   Tables to record measurements from "Measurement Olympics" and calculate averages/ranges.

    *   **Extension Activities:**
        *   Design an experiment specifically focused on *comparing* the accuracy and precision of different measurement tools or methods for the same quantity.  Conduct the experiment and analyse the results.
        *   Research examples of scientific studies where issues of accuracy, precision, or validity have been critical (e.g., in medical trials, environmental monitoring, forensic science). Present findings and discuss the consequences of data quality problems in those cases.
*   **Lesson Materials:**
    *   Slide Deck: Accuracy, precision, validity definitions, examples, strategies for improvement, experimental validity concepts.
    *   Handout: "Measurement Olympics" station instructions and recording sheets, "Validity Challenge" flawed experiment scenario worksheet, definitions of accuracy, precision, validity.
    *   Materials for "Measurement Olympics" stations: Rulers, measuring tapes, digital calipers (optional), various objects for length measurement; electronic balances, triple beam balances, objects for mass measurement; graduated cylinders, beakers, pipettes, liquids for volume measurement; stopwatches (digital preferable), materials for time measurement events (pendulums, ramps, balls).

These revised lesson plans for Week 2, tailored for a selective school, aim to be more challenging, engaging, and practically focused, incorporating active learning, hands-on activities, and critical thinking, while addressing the consolidation of the digital footprint lesson and building a strong foundation in data collection and data quality principles.

Let me know if you'd like me to continue revising lesson plans for Week 3 onwards, or if you have further feedback on these revised Week 2 plans.



## AI Prompt Template: NSW Curriculum-Aligned Year 8 Data Science Teaching Program & Resources

### Goals:

Create a detailed, immersive and curriculum-compliant (# Curriculum Overview: Data Science 1) teaching unit for Year 8 students (13-14 years old) at a NSW selective school.

The deliverables must include clearly structured and pedagogically effective:

1. **Program Plan**
   A complete program overview identifying key outcomes, curriculum-alignment, and clearly mapped learning progressions across each of the ten weeks.

2. **Detailed Lesson Plans** (25 clearly defined 1-hour lesson plans):
   Each lesson includes:
   - Definitive learning objectives aligned explicitly to curriculum standards.
   - Clear skills acquisition outcomes and numeracy literacy links.
   - Edward Tufte-inspired data visualizations to support clarity and robust interpretation of data.
   - Engaging teaching strategies clearly strategic to Year 8 high-achieving students.
   - Workbook exercises developed in markdown format (Jupyter notebooks or Markdown-based interactive workbooks recommended) providing classroom or home-accessible data exploration and visualisation tools.
   - Practical hands-on classroom activities, designed initially for paper/calculator exploration subsequently transitioning to digital workbook and computational exploration.
   - Clearly defined methods for formative assessments monitoring numeric literacy and data handling accuracy.

3. **Classroom Material & Interactive Workbooks**
   - Each lesson to have relevant interactive workbook activities embedding Edward Tufte’s visualization principles—specifically influenced by the key arguments in Tufte’s "Beautiful Evidence" (2006).
   - Student handouts/templates/worksheets clearly supporting workbook exercises.

4. **Assessment Strategies: Formative & Summative**
   - Regular formative assessment strategies (embedded workbook quizzes, quick-tests, numeric literacy checks)
   - One comprehensive end-of-semester summative assessment (exam) clearly testing data interpretation, numeric literacy, visual interpretation capability, computational and conceptual understanding based specifically on lesson outcomes.

5. **Interactive AI Tutor Support**
   Define an AI-guided virtual tutor (briefly outline functional expectations):
   - Available as interactive chat-based Q&A platform, reinforcing weekly concepts
   - Detailed data-science-solving strategies and numeric-literacy feedback mechanisms
   - Ability to review and guide navigation through workbooks
   - Supports real-time formative assessment

6. **AI-Based Review & Improvement**
   - Ensure continuous improvement by defining an AI-based review process for curriculum content effectiveness & workbook engagement metrics, to adjust complexity and depth according to student progress and numeric literacy.

---

## Contextual Alignment and Constraints (from provided curriculum materials):

The teaching sequence must explicitly embed and reference the following curriculum specifications/outcomes from "Curriculum Overview: Data Science 1":

A student:

- Explains how data is used by scientists to model and predict scientific phenomena (SC4-DA1-01)
- Uses data to identify trends, patterns, relationships, and draw conclusions (SC4-WS-06)
- Identifies problem-solving strategies and proposes solutions (SC4-WS-07)

Ensure it explicitly addresses:

- Working Scientifically (Analysing data and information, solving problems).
- Collecting, using, analysing datasets systematically with an emphasis on accuracy, validity, precision.
- Clear understanding of scientific modeling (importance, types, development processes, and real-world applications).
- Practical emphasis on experimental data handling, digital literacy and understanding digital footprints online.

---

## Preferred Pedagogical Approach:

- Strong emphasis on the evidence-based nature of data science. Highlight clearly Lord Kelvin’s concept regarding measurement and evidence:

  > "If you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it. When you can measure what you speak about, express it in numbers, you know something about it; if you cannot measure it, your knowledge is meagre and unsatisfactory.”

- Incremental building of numeric and data literacy, from basic numerical understanding to accurate, precise statistical interpretations.
- Scaffold students’ progression from simple (paper-based/calculator-driven) data collection and analysis to sophisticated digital workbook supported computational tools.
