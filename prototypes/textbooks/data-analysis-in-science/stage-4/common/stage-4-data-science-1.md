    *   Students will understand the limitations of range as a measure of dispersion and recognize the need for more robust measures (to be introduced later).
    *   *NSW Curriculum Outcomes:* SC4-WS-06 (Process data and information), SC4-WS-07 (Communicate information), SC4-DA1-01 (Analyse a model to identify data and trends)
*   **Overview:** This lesson introduces the concept of data dispersion, focusing on the range as a simple measure of spread. Students will learn to calculate range, understand its meaning, use Python in Observable for calculations, and recognize its limitations, setting the stage for more advanced measures of dispersion.
*   **Activities:**
    *   **Warm-Up (10 mins):** "Data Spread Visualisation" - Show two sets of data visually represented (e.g., two line graphs with same mean but different spread, or two sets of bar graphs with different variability). Ask students: "Which dataset is more spread out? How can you describe or measure this 'spread'?"  Lead to the idea of data dispersion and the need for measures beyond central tendency.
    *   **Main Activity 1: "Range Definition and Calculation" (25 mins):**
        *   Introduce and define Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.
        *   Step-by-step calculation examples for range using small datasets (by hand). Example: Dataset: [12, 15, 18, 20, 25]. Range = 25 - 12 = 13.
        *   Explain how range describes the total spread of the data â€“ how much the values vary from the lowest to the highest. A larger range indicates greater dispersion.
        *   Worksheet practice: Provide students with several datasets. Students calculate the range for each dataset by hand. Check answers as a class.
    *   **Main Activity 2: "Range in Python (Observable)" (20 mins):**
        *   Introduce how to calculate range using Python in Observable. (Note: NumPy doesn't directly have a 'range' function in the statistical sense, so we'll use `max()` and `min()` and subtraction).

            *   Create a code cell.
            *   Create a Python list of numbers representing a scientific dataset.
            *   Use `numpy.max()` to find the maximum value, `numpy.min()` to find the minimum value, and subtract to calculate the range.
            *   Print the result with a clear label (e.g., "Data Range:", data\_range).
        *   Student practice: Provide students with new datasets in Observable. Students write Python code to calculate and display the range.
    *   **Reflection & Discussion (10 mins):** Class discussion:
        *   What does the range tell us about a dataset that central tendency measures (mean, median, mode) don't?
        *   Compare datasets with the same mean but different ranges. What does the range reveal in this case?
        *   What are the limitations of using range as the *only* measure of data dispersion? (e.g., sensitive to outliers, doesn't describe the distribution within the range).
        *   When might range be a useful measure despite its limitations? (e.g., quick overview of spread, in situations where outliers are not a major concern).
    *   **Assessments:**
        *   Formative Task (5 mins): "Range Calculation Quiz" - Quick calculation of range for a very simple dataset. AI-generated quiz.

Students will learn to spot outliers visually and numerically (conceptually), understand their potential causes, and discuss responsible strategies for handling outliers in scientific data analysis.
*   **Activities:**
    *   **Warm-Up (10 mins):** "Spot the Odd One Out" - Present a series of lists of numbers or objects where one item is clearly an outlier (e.g., ages of students in a class with one value of 90, heights of plants with one value much taller than others). Ask students: "In each list, which value seems unusual or doesn't fit with the others? Why do you think it's unusual?" Lead to the concept of outliers as data points that are different from the rest.
    *   **Main Activity 1: "What are Outliers? Definition and Visual Identification" (25 mins):**
        *   Define Outliers: Data points that are significantly different from other values in a dataset. They lie far away from the main cluster of data.
        *   Discuss potential causes of outliers:
            *   **Errors in data collection or measurement:** Mistakes in recording data, faulty equipment.
            *   **Natural variation:** Genuine extreme values within a distribution (e.g., exceptionally tall person in a height dataset).
            *   **Interesting anomalies or new discoveries:** Outliers might represent something significant or unexpected that needs further investigation (e.g., unexpected experimental result, indication of a new phenomenon).
        *   Visual identification of outliers using graphs:

        *   Introduce the concept of numerical outlier detection (without going into complex formulas at Year 8 level).
        *   Explain the idea of using standard deviation (conceptually - "how spread out the data is") or IQR (Interquartile Range - if introduced in previous extension activity) to define outlier boundaries.
        *   Simplified rule example:  "Values that are much further than the typical spread from the mean or median might be outliers." (Avoid precise formulas at this stage).
        *   "Outlier Spotting Challenge (Numerical - Simplified Rule)" - Provide datasets and a simplified rule (e.g., "values more than 2 times the range away from the median are potential outliers"). Students apply the rule to identify potential outliers. Discuss that these are just guidelines, not definitive rules.
    *   **Reflection & Discussion (10 mins):** Class discussion:
        *   Why is it important to identify outliers in scientific data?
        *   What are some possible reasons for outliers to occur?
        *   What should scientists do when they find outliers in their data? (Discuss different approaches - investigate, correct, remove, keep - and the importance of justification and transparency).

    *   Students will be able to design basic controlled experiments to investigate scientific questions, identifying variables and controls.
    *   *NSW Curriculum Outcomes:* SC4-WS-02 (Planning investigations), ACSIS125 (Conducting investigations safely).
*   **Overview:** This lesson focuses on the fundamental principles of experimental design, emphasizing variables, controls, and experimental groups. Students will learn to identify different types of variables, understand the importance of controls, and design their own controlled experiments.
*   **Activities:**
    *   **Warm-Up (10 mins):** "Variable Scenarios" - Present several simple experimental scenarios (verbally or on slides - e.g., plant growth experiment, reaction rate experiment, survey on sleep habits). For each scenario, ask students: "What factor are we changing or manipulating in this experiment? What factor are we measuring or observing to see if it changes? What factors should we keep the same to make it a fair test?"  Lead to the concepts of independent, dependent, and controlled variables.
    *   **Main Activity 1: "Variables Unpacked: Independent, Dependent, Controlled" (25 mins):**
        *   Introduce and define:
            *   **Independent Variable:** The factor that is deliberately changed or manipulated by the experimenter (the "cause").
            *   **Dependent Variable:** The factor that is measured or observed to see if it is affected by the independent variable (the "effect").
            *   **Controlled Variables (Constants):** Factors that are kept constant throughout the experiment to ensure a fair test and isolate the effect of the independent variable.
        *   Use real-world examples and analogies to explain each variable type (e.g., in a recipe, changing oven temperature (independent) and measuring cake rise (dependent), while keeping ingredients and baking time constant (controlled)).
        *   "Variable Identification Challenge": Provide students with descriptions of different experiments (from various science topics). For each experiment, students identify the independent variable, dependent variable, and list several important controlled variables. Discuss as a class and clarify variable types.

            *   **Control Group:** A group that does *not* receive the treatment or manipulation (independent variable is kept at a standard or baseline level). Serves as a baseline for comparison.
        *   Explain why control groups are essential for drawing valid conclusions in experiments: To isolate the effect of the independent variable and rule out other factors.
        *   "Control Group Design Challenge": Present scientific questions that require controlled experiments (e.g., "Does a new fertilizer increase plant growth?", "Does a new drug reduce reaction time?"). For each question, students design a basic controlled experiment, specifying:
            *   Independent Variable and how it will be manipulated.
            *   Dependent Variable and how it will be measured.
            *   Controlled Variables (list at least 3).
            *   Experimental Group(s) and Control Group(s) description.

    *   Students will be able to define and manipulate variables (independent and dependent) using Python code in Observable to simulate experimental conditions.
    *   Students will be able to simulate data collection within Observable by generating or inputting data based on their virtual experiment design.
    *   Students will be able to analyse and interpret simulated data in Observable to draw conclusions about their virtual experiment.
    *   *NSW Curriculum Outcomes:* SC4-WS-03 (Using digital technologies), SC4-WS-05 (Using data to develop conclusions), ACSIS125 (Planning and conducting investigations), ACSIS126 (Processing and analysing data).
*   **Overview:** This lesson provides a hands-on experience in designing and conducting virtual experiments using Observable notebooks. Students will learn to translate experimental designs into code, manipulate variables, simulate data collection, and analyse the resulting data within the interactive Observable environment.
*   **Activities:**
    *   **Warm-Up (10 mins):** "Why Virtual Experiments?" - Class discussion: "What are the advantages of using computer simulations or virtual experiments in science? When might virtual experiments be useful or necessary compared to real-world experiments?" (e.g., safety, cost, time, ethical reasons, studying complex systems). Brainstorm examples of scientific areas where simulations are widely used (climate modelling, physics simulations, disease spread models).
    *   **Main Activity 1: "Guided Virtual Experiment Design - Plant Growth Simulation" (25 mins):**
        *   Guided, step-by-step activity to design a simple virtual experiment in Observable simulating plant growth under different light conditions.
        *   Provide a template Observable notebook (partially completed notebook with markdown instructions and code cells).
        *   Guide students through the steps:
            *   **Define the Scientific Question:** "Does light intensity affect plant growth?" (or similar, more specific question).
            *   **Identify Variables:** Independent Variable (light intensity - categories: Low, Medium, High), Dependent Variable (plant height after 2 weeks - in cm).
            *   **Design Control:**  Other factors kept constant (water, soil type, temperature â€“ conceptually).
            *   **Simulate Data Collection (using Python code):** In a code cell, provide code to:
                *   Generate simulated plant height data for each light intensity level. Use `numpy.random` to create somewhat variable data to mimic real-world variability (e.g., using `numpy.random.normal()` with different means for each light level and some standard deviation). Example code snippet:
                    ```python
                    import numpy as np
                    light_levels = ["Low", "Medium", "High"]
                    plant_heights = {}
                    for level in light_levels:
                        if level == "Low":
                            plant_heights[level] = np.random.normal(5, 1.5, 20) # Mean 5cm, SD 1.5cm, 20 samples
                        elif level == "Medium":
                            plant_heights[level] = np.random.normal(8, 2, 20) # Mean 8cm, SD 2cm, 20 samples
                        else: # High
                            plant_heights[level] = np.random.normal(12, 2.5, 20) # Mean 12cm, SD 2.5cm, 20 samples
                        print(f"Simulated plant heights for {level} light: {plant_heights[level]}")
                    ```
                *   Store the simulated data in a dictionary or Pandas DataFrame.
            *   **Data Visualization:** In a code cell, provide code to create a bar graph (or box plot) in Observable using Plot library to visualize the simulated plant heights for each light level and compare them. Example using Plot:
                ```python
                import {Plot} from "@observablehq/plot"
                Plot.plot({
                  marks: [
                    Plot.barY(
                      light_levels.flatMap(level => plant_heights[level].map(height => ({level: level, height: height}))),
                      {x: "level", y: "height", fill: "level", tip: true}
                    )
                  ],
                  x: {label: "Light Intensity"},
                  y: {label: "Plant Height (cm)"},
                  color: {domain: light_levels}
                })
                ```
            *   **Data Analysis and Interpretation:** In markdown cells, guide students to:
                *   Describe the trends they observe in the simulated data from the graph and the printed data.
                *   Answer the scientific question: "Does light intensity affect plant growth?" based on the simulated data.
                *   Discuss limitations of the virtual experiment and how it could be improved or extended.
        *   Students work through the guided virtual experiment in Observable, running code cells, modifying parameters (e.g., changing means, standard deviations in data generation code), and observing how changes in variables affect the simulated data and visualizations.
    *   **Reflection & Discussion (10 mins):** Class discussion:

*   **Activities:**
    *   **Warm-Up (10 mins):** "Data Disaster Stories" - Briefly share a few real-world examples of situations where poor data quality led to problems or incorrect conclusions (e.g., a flawed scientific study due to data errors, a business decision based on inaccurate data, a software bug caused by unexpected data input). Discuss: What are the potential consequences of using "messy" data? Why is data quality important?
    *   **Main Activity 1: "The Messy Dataset Exploration" (25 mins):**
        *   Provide students with a pre-prepared "messy" dataset (digital file - CSV or similar). The dataset should contain various data quality issues (examples below).

        *   Guide students to explore the dataset in Observable (using a Pandas DataFrame in a code cell).
        *   Ask students to investigate and identify different types of data quality issues within the dataset. Guide them to look for:
            *   **Missing Values (NaN, empty cells):**  Use `pandas.DataFrame.isnull()` or `pandas.DataFrame.isna()` and `sum()` to count missing values per column.
            *   **Inconsistent Formats (e.g., dates, text case):** Show examples of inconsistent date formats (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY, DD-MM-YYYY), inconsistent text casing (e.g., "Yes", "yes", "YES"). Use `pandas.DataFrame.info()` to check data types.
            *   **Errors and Typos:**  Point out obvious errors, impossible values, or typos in text data.

        *   For each category, brainstorm potential reasons why these issues might occur in real-world data collection.
        *   For each category, brainstorm general strategies or approaches that data scientists use to address these data quality issues (e.g., for missing values: remove, fill in/impute; for inconsistencies: standardize formats; for errors: correct if possible, remove if not; for bias: be aware, try to mitigate if possible, acknowledge limitations).  Focus on *conceptual* solutions at this stage, not specific coding techniques yet.

Students will learn the basic principles of building predictive models, understand key terminology, and ideally get hands-on experience with a visual, user-friendly predictive modelling tool (if feasible and accessible).
*   **Activities:**
    *   **Warm-Up (10 mins):** "Prediction Scenarios" - Present several everyday prediction scenarios (e.g., weather forecast, predicting sports game outcome, predicting traffic congestion, predicting movie box office success). For each scenario, ask students: "What information or data do you think is used to make this prediction? What is being predicted?" Discuss the idea of using data to make predictions.
    *   **Main Activity 1: "What is Predictive Modelling? - Looking into the Crystal Ball" (25 mins):**
        *   Introduce the concept of Predictive Modelling: "Using data and algorithms to build models that can predict future outcomes or unknown values based on patterns learned from past data."
        *   Explain the key steps in building a predictive model (simplified, conceptual level):
            *   **Training the Model:**  The model "learns" patterns and relationships from a dataset called the "training data."  This is like teaching a computer to recognize patterns.
            *   **Features:**  These are the input variables or characteristics used to make predictions (e.g., in weather prediction: temperature, humidity, wind speed; in predicting house price: size, location, number of bedrooms).
            *   **Target Variable:** This is the variable we want to predict (e.g., weather: temperature tomorrow; house price: selling price).
            *   **Making Predictions:** Once trained, the model can use new data (features) to predict the target variable for unseen situations.
            *   **Evaluating the Model:**  After building a model, we need to check how accurate its predictions are. This is called "model evaluation."
        *   Use analogies to explain these concepts (e.g., training a dog to recognize commands, learning from examples in a textbook).
        *   Examples of Predictive Modelling in Science:
            *   **Weather Forecasting:** Predicting future weather conditions based on current and past weather data.
            *   **Disease Prediction in Medicine:** Predicting patient risk of developing a disease based on medical history, genetics, lifestyle data.
            *   **Predicting Species Distribution in Ecology:** Predicting where different species are likely to be found based on environmental factors and species occurrence data.
    *   **Main Activity 2: "Hands-on Predictive Modelling with a Visual Tool (If Feasible)" (20 mins):**
        *   If a simplified, user-friendly visual predictive modelling tool is available and suitable for Year 8 (e.g., a drag-and-drop online tool, or a very basic feature in a data visualization platform), guide students to use it for a simple predictive modelling task.
        *   Example task: Predicting house prices based on features like size and location (using a simplified dataset and tool).
        *   Steps (if using a visual tool):
            *   Load a simplified dataset into the tool.
            *   Identify features (input variables) and target variable (output to predict).
            *   Use the tool's interface to "train" a basic predictive model.
            *   Use the trained model to make predictions for new data points.
            *   Evaluate the model's performance (if the tool provides any basic evaluation metrics).
        *   If a visual tool is not feasible, demonstrate a very simplified predictive modelling example conceptually using a simple dataset and a basic rule or pattern that could be used for prediction.

*   **Activities:**
    *   **Warm-Up (10 mins):** "Ethical Dilemma Scenarios (General)" - Present a few short ethical dilemma scenarios that are not directly related to AI but introduce the concept of ethical decision-making and trade-offs (e.g., a scenario about resource allocation, a scenario about honesty vs. loyalty). Discuss: What are the ethical issues in this scenario? Are there different perspectives on what is "right"? How do you make an ethical decision when there are competing values? Lead to the idea of ethical considerations being complex and important.
    *   **Main Activity 1: "Bias in AI - Unintended Consequences" (25 mins):**
        *   Introduce the concept of Bias in AI: "AI systems can unintentionally learn and perpetuate biases that exist in the data they are trained on, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes."
        *   Explain potential sources of bias in AI:
            *   **Data Bias:** Biases present in the training data itself (e.g., historical data reflecting societal biases, underrepresentation of certain groups in datasets).
            *   **Algorithm Bias:** Biases introduced by the design of the AI algorithm itself (less common but possible).
            *   **Human Bias:** Biases of the people who design, develop, and deploy AI systems.
        *   Examples of AI Bias and its consequences:
            *   **Facial Recognition Bias:** AI facial recognition systems being less accurate in recognizing faces of people with darker skin tones due to biased training data. (Show visual examples if appropriate and sensitive).
            *   **Hiring Algorithm Bias:** AI hiring tools inadvertently discriminating against certain demographic groups based on patterns learned from biased historical hiring data.
            *   **Loan Application Bias:** AI loan approval systems showing bias against certain groups, perpetuating existing inequalities.
        *   "Bias Detection Challenge": Present simplified scenarios or short descriptions of AI systems. Ask students to identify potential sources of bias and possible consequences of biased outcomes in each scenario. Discuss: How can we detect and mitigate bias in AI systems?
    *   **Main Activity 2: "Data Privacy and Transparency in AI" (20 mins):**
        *   Discuss Data Privacy Concerns in AI: AI systems often rely on large amounts of personal data.  It's crucial to consider how this data is collected, used, stored, and protected.  Discuss issues like:
            *   Informed consent for data collection.
            *   Anonymization and de-identification of data.
            *   Data security and preventing data breaches.
            *   Potential for misuse of personal data.
        *   Explain the importance of Transparency and Explainability in AI, especially in critical applications (e.g., healthcare, justice). "Black Box" AI systems (where it's hard to understand how they make decisions) can raise ethical concerns.  Transparency means making AI systems more understandable and explainable.
        *   Examples of ethical considerations related to privacy and transparency:
            *   **Use of AI in Healthcare Diagnosis:**  Ethical need for transparency and explainability in AI diagnostic tools so doctors and patients can understand the reasoning behind AI recommendations.
            *   **AI in Criminal Justice (Risk Assessment Tools):**  Ethical concerns about using "black box" AI algorithms to assess criminal risk without transparency about how these algorithms work and potential biases.
            *   **Data Collection for AI Surveillance Systems:**  Ethical considerations around privacy and potential for misuse of large-scale AI-powered surveillance.
        *   "Ethical AI Principles Brainstorm": In groups, students brainstorm a list of ethical principles or guidelines that should be followed when developing and using AI in data science to address issues of bias, privacy, and transparency. Share and discuss principles as a class.
    *   **Reflection & Discussion (10 mins):** Class discussion:
        *   Why are ethical considerations so important in the field of AI and data science?
        *   What are the potential harms or negative consequences of unethical AI development and use?
