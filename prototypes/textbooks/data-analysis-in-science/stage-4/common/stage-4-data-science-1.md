*   **Activities:**
    *   **Warm-Up (10 mins):** "Guess the Average" - Present a few sets of simple numbers (e.g., ages of students in a small group, number of petals on different flowers).  Ask students to quickly estimate the "average" value for each set. Discuss: What does "average" mean in everyday language? Are there different ways to think about "average"?
    *   **Main Activity 1: "Mean, Median, Mode Definitions and Calculations" (25 mins):**

*   **Learning Outcomes:**
    *   Students will be able to define and calculate the range of a dataset.
    *   Students will be able to explain how range describes the dispersion or spread of data.
    *   Students will be able to calculate range using Python in Observable notebooks.
    *   Students will be able to interpret the range in the context of scientific data and compare the spread of different datasets.
    *   Students will understand the limitations of range as a measure of dispersion and recognize the need for more robust measures (to be introduced later).
    *   *NSW Curriculum Outcomes:* SC4-WS-06 (Process data and information), SC4-WS-07 (Communicate information), SC4-DA1-01 (Analyse a model to identify data and trends)
*   **Overview:** This lesson introduces the concept of data dispersion, focusing on the range as a simple measure of spread. Students will learn to calculate range, understand its meaning, use Python in Observable for calculations, and recognize its limitations, setting the stage for more advanced measures of dispersion.
*   **Activities:**
    *   **Warm-Up (10 mins):** "Data Spread Visualisation" - Show two sets of data visually represented (e.g., two line graphs with same mean but different spread, or two sets of bar graphs with different variability). Ask students: "Which dataset is more spread out? How can you describe or measure this 'spread'?"  Lead to the idea of data dispersion and the need for measures beyond central tendency.
    *   **Main Activity 1: "Range Definition and Calculation" (25 mins):**
        *   Introduce and define Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.
        *   Step-by-step calculation examples for range using small datasets (by hand). Example: Dataset: [12, 15, 18, 20, 25]. Range = 25 - 12 = 13.
        *   Explain how range describes the total spread of the data – how much the values vary from the lowest to the highest. A larger range indicates greater dispersion.
        *   Worksheet practice: Provide students with several datasets. Students calculate the range for each dataset by hand. Check answers as a class.
    *   **Main Activity 2: "Range in Python (Observable)" (20 mins):**
        *   Introduce how to calculate range using Python in Observable. (Note: NumPy doesn't directly have a 'range' function in the statistical sense, so we'll use `max()` and `min()` and subtraction).
        *   Guided code-along in Observable:
            *   Create a code cell.
            *   Create a Python list of numbers representing a scientific dataset.
            *   Use `numpy.max()` to find the maximum value, `numpy.min()` to find the minimum value, and subtract to calculate the range.
            *   Print the result with a clear label (e.g., "Data Range:", data\_range).
        *   Student practice: Provide students with new datasets in Observable. Students write Python code to calculate and display the range.
    *   **Reflection & Discussion (10 mins):** Class discussion:
        *   What does the range tell us about a dataset that central tendency measures (mean, median, mode) don't?
        *   Compare datasets with the same mean but different ranges. What does the range reveal in this case?
        *   What are the limitations of using range as the *only* measure of data dispersion? (e.g., sensitive to outliers, doesn't describe the distribution within the range).
        *   When might range be a useful measure despite its limitations? (e.g., quick overview of spread, in situations where outliers are not a major concern).
    *   **Assessments:**
        *   Formative Task (5 mins): "Range Calculation Quiz" - Quick calculation of range for a very simple dataset. AI-generated quiz.

        *   Challenge: Investigate and compare range to other measures of dispersion like interquartile range (IQR) and standard deviation (brief conceptual introduction to IQR).
*   **Lesson Materials:**

    *   Students will be able to define outliers as unusual or extreme values in a dataset.
    *   Students will be able to identify outliers visually using graphs (e.g., box plots, scatter plots) and numerically using simple rules (e.g., beyond a certain number of standard deviations from the mean – conceptual).
    *   Students will be able to interpret potential causes of outliers (errors, natural variation, interesting anomalies).
    *   Students will be able to discuss appropriate strategies for handling outliers in data analysis (investigate, correct, remove with justification, or keep).
    *   *NSW Curriculum Outcomes:* SC4-WS-06 (Process data and information), SC4-WS-07 (Communicate information), SC4-DA1-01 (Analyse a model to identify data and trends)
*   **Overview:** This lesson introduces outliers as unusual data points and equips students with methods to identify and interpret them. Students will learn to spot outliers visually and numerically (conceptually), understand their potential causes, and discuss responsible strategies for handling outliers in scientific data analysis.
*   **Activities:**
    *   **Warm-Up (10 mins):** "Spot the Odd One Out" - Present a series of lists of numbers or objects where one item is clearly an outlier (e.g., ages of students in a class with one value of 90, heights of plants with one value much taller than others). Ask students: "In each list, which value seems unusual or doesn't fit with the others? Why do you think it's unusual?" Lead to the concept of outliers as data points that are different from the rest.
    *   **Main Activity 1: "What are Outliers? Definition and Visual Identification" (25 mins):**
        *   Define Outliers: Data points that are significantly different from other values in a dataset. They lie far away from the main cluster of data.
        *   Discuss potential causes of outliers:
            *   **Errors in data collection or measurement:** Mistakes in recording data, faulty equipment.
            *   **Natural variation:** Genuine extreme values within a distribution (e.g., exceptionally tall person in a height dataset).
            *   **Interesting anomalies or new discoveries:** Outliers might represent something significant or unexpected that needs further investigation (e.g., unexpected experimental result, indication of a new phenomenon).
        *   Visual identification of outliers using graphs:
            *   **Box Plots:** Show how outliers are represented as points beyond the whiskers of a box plot.
            *   **Scatter Plots:** Show how outliers are points far away from the main cluster in a scatter plot.
            *   Demonstrate creating simple box plots in Observable (using Plot library - basic example).

    *   **Main Activity 2: "Numerical Outlier Identification (Conceptual)" (20 mins):**
        *   Introduce the concept of numerical outlier detection (without going into complex formulas at Year 8 level).
        *   Explain the idea of using standard deviation (conceptually - "how spread out the data is") or IQR (Interquartile Range - if introduced in previous extension activity) to define outlier boundaries.
        *   Simplified rule example:  "Values that are much further than the typical spread from the mean or median might be outliers." (Avoid precise formulas at this stage).
        *   "Outlier Spotting Challenge (Numerical - Simplified Rule)" - Provide datasets and a simplified rule (e.g., "values more than 2 times the range away from the median are potential outliers"). Students apply the rule to identify potential outliers. Discuss that these are just guidelines, not definitive rules.
    *   **Reflection & Discussion (10 mins):** Class discussion:
        *   Why is it important to identify outliers in scientific data?
        *   What are some possible reasons for outliers to occur?
        *   What should scientists do when they find outliers in their data? (Discuss different approaches - investigate, correct, remove, keep - and the importance of justification and transparency).
        *   Is it always "bad" to have outliers? Can outliers sometimes be important or interesting?

        *   Students research real-world examples of significant scientific discoveries that were initially considered outliers or anomalies (e.g., discovery of penicillin, unexpected astronomical observations).
        *   Challenge: Investigate more formal methods for numerical outlier detection (e.g., using z-scores, IQR rule – more detailed explanation of IQR). Implement a simple outlier detection function in Python in Observable using one of these methods (if appropriate for Year 8 level).
*   **Lesson Materials:**
        *   Slide Deck: Introduction to outliers, definition, causes, visual outlier identification (box plots, scatter plots), numerical outlier identification (conceptual), handling outliers, importance of outliers.

    *   Students will be able to explain the purpose of control groups and experimental groups in controlled experiments.
    *   Students will be able to design basic controlled experiments to investigate scientific questions, identifying variables and controls.
    *   *NSW Curriculum Outcomes:* SC4-WS-02 (Planning investigations), ACSIS125 (Conducting investigations safely).
*   **Overview:** This lesson focuses on the fundamental principles of experimental design, emphasizing variables, controls, and experimental groups. Students will learn to identify different types of variables, understand the importance of controls, and design their own controlled experiments.
*   **Activities:**
    *   **Warm-Up (10 mins):** "Variable Scenarios" - Present several simple experimental scenarios (verbally or on slides - e.g., plant growth experiment, reaction rate experiment, survey on sleep habits). For each scenario, ask students: "What factor are we changing or manipulating in this experiment? What factor are we measuring or observing to see if it changes? What factors should we keep the same to make it a fair test?"  Lead to the concepts of independent, dependent, and controlled variables.
    *   **Main Activity 1: "Variables Unpacked: Independent, Dependent, Controlled" (25 mins):**
        *   Introduce and define:
            *   **Independent Variable:** The factor that is deliberately changed or manipulated by the experimenter (the "cause").
            *   **Dependent Variable:** The factor that is measured or observed to see if it is affected by the independent variable (the "effect").
            *   **Controlled Variables (Constants):** Factors that are kept constant throughout the experiment to ensure a fair test and isolate the effect of the independent variable.
        *   Use real-world examples and analogies to explain each variable type (e.g., in a recipe, changing oven temperature (independent) and measuring cake rise (dependent), while keeping ingredients and baking time constant (controlled)).
        *   "Variable Identification Challenge": Provide students with descriptions of different experiments (from various science topics). For each experiment, students identify the independent variable, dependent variable, and list several important controlled variables. Discuss as a class and clarify variable types.
    *   **Main Activity 2: "Control Groups and Experimental Groups - The Power of Comparison" (20 mins):**
        *   Explain the purpose of control groups and experimental groups in controlled experiments:
            *   **Experimental Group(s):** Group(s) that receive the treatment or manipulation (the independent variable is changed).
            *   **Control Group:** A group that does *not* receive the treatment or manipulation (independent variable is kept at a standard or baseline level). Serves as a baseline for comparison.
        *   Explain why control groups are essential for drawing valid conclusions in experiments: To isolate the effect of the independent variable and rule out other factors.
        *   "Control Group Design Challenge": Present scientific questions that require controlled experiments (e.g., "Does a new fertilizer increase plant growth?", "Does a new drug reduce reaction time?"). For each question, students design a basic controlled experiment, specifying:
            *   Independent Variable and how it will be manipulated.
            *   Dependent Variable and how it will be measured.
            *   Controlled Variables (list at least 3).
            *   Experimental Group(s) and Control Group(s) description.
        *   Groups share their experimental designs. Class feedback and discussion – peer review of experimental designs, focusing on clarity of variables and effective use of control groups.
    *   **Reflection & Discussion (10 mins):** Class discussion:
        *   Why are variables and controls so important in experimental design?
        *   What happens if you don't control variables properly in an experiment? What kind of conclusions can you draw?
        *   Why is a control group essential for a valid controlled experiment?
        *   What are some real-world examples where controlled experiments are used to test new ideas or products?

    *   Students will be able to define and manipulate variables (independent and dependent) using Python code in Observable to simulate experimental conditions.
    *   Students will be able to simulate data collection within Observable by generating or inputting data based on their virtual experiment design.
    *   Students will be able to analyse and interpret simulated data in Observable to draw conclusions about their virtual experiment.
    *   *NSW Curriculum Outcomes:* SC4-WS-03 (Using digital technologies), SC4-WS-05 (Using data to develop conclusions), ACSIS125 (Planning and conducting investigations), ACSIS126 (Processing and analysing data).
*   **Overview:** This lesson provides a hands-on experience in designing and conducting virtual experiments using Observable notebooks. Students will learn to translate experimental designs into code, manipulate variables, simulate data collection, and analyse the resulting data within the interactive Observable environment.
*   **Activities:**
    *   **Warm-Up (10 mins):** "Why Virtual Experiments?" - Class discussion: "What are the advantages of using computer simulations or virtual experiments in science? When might virtual experiments be useful or necessary compared to real-world experiments?" (e.g., safety, cost, time, ethical reasons, studying complex systems). Brainstorm examples of scientific areas where simulations are widely used (climate modelling, physics simulations, disease spread models).
    *   **Main Activity 1: "Guided Virtual Experiment Design - Plant Growth Simulation" (25 mins):**
        *   Guided, step-by-step activity to design a simple virtual experiment in Observable simulating plant growth under different light conditions.
        *   Provide a template Observable notebook (partially completed notebook with markdown instructions and code cells).
        *   Guide students through the steps:
            *   **Define the Scientific Question:** "Does light intensity affect plant growth?" (or similar, more specific question).
            *   **Identify Variables:** Independent Variable (light intensity - categories: Low, Medium, High), Dependent Variable (plant height after 2 weeks - in cm).
            *   **Design Control:**  Other factors kept constant (water, soil type, temperature – conceptually).
            *   **Simulate Data Collection (using Python code):** In a code cell, provide code to:
                *   Generate simulated plant height data for each light intensity level. Use `numpy.random` to create somewhat variable data to mimic real-world variability (e.g., using `numpy.random.normal()` with different means for each light level and some standard deviation). Example code snippet:
                    ```python
                    import numpy as np
                    light_levels = ["Low", "Medium", "High"]
                    plant_heights = {}
                    for level in light_levels:
                        if level == "Low":
                            plant_heights[level] = np.random.normal(5, 1.5, 20) # Mean 5cm, SD 1.5cm, 20 samples
                        elif level == "Medium":
                            plant_heights[level] = np.random.normal(8, 2, 20) # Mean 8cm, SD 2cm, 20 samples
                        else: # High
                            plant_heights[level] = np.random.normal(12, 2.5, 20) # Mean 12cm, SD 2.5cm, 20 samples
                        print(f"Simulated plant heights for {level} light: {plant_heights[level]}")
                    ```
                *   Store the simulated data in a dictionary or Pandas DataFrame.
            *   **Data Visualization:** In a code cell, provide code to create a bar graph (or box plot) in Observable using Plot library to visualize the simulated plant heights for each light level and compare them. Example using Plot:
                ```python
                import {Plot} from "@observablehq/plot"
                Plot.plot({
                  marks: [
                    Plot.barY(
                      light_levels.flatMap(level => plant_heights[level].map(height => ({level: level, height: height}))),
                      {x: "level", y: "height", fill: "level", tip: true}
                    )
                  ],
                  x: {label: "Light Intensity"},
                  y: {label: "Plant Height (cm)"},
                  color: {domain: light_levels}
                })
                ```
            *   **Data Analysis and Interpretation:** In markdown cells, guide students to:
                *   Describe the trends they observe in the simulated data from the graph and the printed data.
                *   Answer the scientific question: "Does light intensity affect plant growth?" based on the simulated data.
                *   Discuss limitations of the virtual experiment and how it could be improved or extended.
        *   Students work through the guided virtual experiment in Observable, running code cells, modifying parameters (e.g., changing means, standard deviations in data generation code), and observing how changes in variables affect the simulated data and visualizations.
    *   **Reflection & Discussion (10 mins):** Class discussion:
        *   What did you learn about designing and conducting experiments from this virtual experiment activity?
        *   How does Observable help in conducting virtual experiments and analysing data? What are the advantages of using Observable for this?

    *   Students will be able to identify common data quality problems, including missing values, inconsistent formats, errors, and biases.
    *   Students will understand the importance of data cleaning and data quality control in ensuring reliable data analysis.
    *   *NSW Curriculum Outcomes:* SC4-WS-06 (Process data and information), SC4-WS-07 (Communicate information), SC4-DA1-01 (Examine a range of sources of data).
*   **Overview:** This lesson introduces students to the realities of working with real-world data. They will explore common data quality issues, understand why data cleaning is essential, and begin to appreciate the complexities of data preparation for analysis.
*   **Activities:**
    *   **Warm-Up (10 mins):** "Data Disaster Stories" - Briefly share a few real-world examples of situations where poor data quality led to problems or incorrect conclusions (e.g., a flawed scientific study due to data errors, a business decision based on inaccurate data, a software bug caused by unexpected data input). Discuss: What are the potential consequences of using "messy" data? Why is data quality important?
    *   **Main Activity 1: "The Messy Dataset Exploration" (25 mins):**
        *   Provide students with a pre-prepared "messy" dataset (digital file - CSV or similar). The dataset should contain various data quality issues (examples below). The dataset can be related to a scientific topic relevant to Year 8 (e.g., environmental data, survey data, experimental results).
        *   Guide students to explore the dataset in Observable (using a Pandas DataFrame in a code cell).
        *   Ask students to investigate and identify different types of data quality issues within the dataset. Guide them to look for:
            *   **Missing Values (NaN, empty cells):**  Use `pandas.DataFrame.isnull()` or `pandas.DataFrame.isna()` and `sum()` to count missing values per column.
            *   **Inconsistent Formats (e.g., dates, text case):** Show examples of inconsistent date formats (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY, DD-MM-YYYY), inconsistent text casing (e.g., "Yes", "yes", "YES"). Use `pandas.DataFrame.info()` to check data types.
            *   **Errors and Typos:**  Point out obvious errors, impossible values, or typos in text data.
            *   **Outliers (Review from Week 4):** Remind students about outliers and how they might be data quality issues or genuine extreme values.
            *   **Potential Biases (Introduce Conceptually):**  Briefly introduce the idea that data can be biased in how it is collected or represented.  (More detail on bias in later lessons).
        *   Students document the data quality issues they find in a markdown cell in their Observable notebook, describing the type of issue and providing specific examples from the dataset.
    *   **Main Activity 2: "Categorizing Data Quality Issues and Brainstorming Solutions" (20 mins):**
        *   Class discussion: Based on the messy dataset exploration, categorize the identified data quality issues into broader categories (e.g., Missingness, Inconsistency, Errors, Bias – simplified categories for Year 8).
        *   For each category, brainstorm potential reasons why these issues might occur in real-world data collection.
        *   For each category, brainstorm general strategies or approaches that data scientists use to address these data quality issues (e.g., for missing values: remove, fill in/impute; for inconsistencies: standardize formats; for errors: correct if possible, remove if not; for bias: be aware, try to mitigate if possible, acknowledge limitations).  Focus on *conceptual* solutions at this stage, not specific coding techniques yet.
    *   **Reflection & Discussion (10 mins):** Class discussion:
        *   Why is it important to be aware of data quality issues before analysing data?
        *   What are the potential consequences of ignoring data quality problems in scientific research or real-world applications?
        *   Is it always possible to completely "clean" a messy dataset? What are the trade-offs and limitations?
        *   How can we design data collection processes to minimize data quality issues from the start? (Preventative measures).

Students will learn practical coding skills to handle missing values, standardize formats, and correct simple errors in datasets, building upon the data quality issues explored in the previous lesson.
*   **Activities:**
    *   **Warm-Up (10 mins):** "Data Cleaning Scenarios" - Present a few short scenarios describing data quality issues in a dataset (e.g., "A column has missing values", "Date formats are inconsistent", "Text data has mixed casing"). For each scenario, ask students: "What is the data quality issue? What is a possible strategy to address this issue?"  Brief class discussion to review conceptual solutions from the previous lesson.

            *   Introduce `pandas.DataFrame.dropna()` to remove rows or columns with missing values. Demonstrate both `dropna()` with default settings and using `axis` parameter to drop columns. Discuss when dropping rows vs. columns might be appropriate (and potential drawbacks of data loss).
            *   Introduce `pandas.DataFrame.fillna()` to fill missing values with a specific value (e.g., mean, median, 0, a placeholder string). Demonstrate filling with a constant value and with the mean of a column. Discuss when imputation might be preferred over dropping data.
        *   Student practice: Provide students with datasets containing missing values in Observable. Students write Python code in their notebooks to:
            *   Detect and count missing values.
            *   Experiment with both `dropna()` and `fillna()` to handle the missing values.

            *   Demonstrate:
                *   **Converting Data Types:** Use `pandas.Series.astype()` to convert columns to appropriate data types (e.g., converting a column of strings representing numbers to numeric type `float` or `int`, converting date strings to `datetime` objects using `pandas.to_datetime()`).
                *   **Standardizing Text Case:** Use `pandas.Series.str.lower()` or `pandas.Series.str.upper()` to standardize text casing in text columns.

*   **Overview:** This lesson provides a conceptual introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its role in modern data analysis. Students will explore how AI is used for pattern recognition, data summarization, and extracting insights from complex datasets, focusing on applications in scientific domains.
*   **Activities:**
    *   **Warm-Up (10 mins):** "Pattern Recognition Challenge" - Show students a series of visual patterns (simple geometric patterns, sequences, or even more complex images with patterns like animal camouflage or constellations). Ask students to identify the patterns they see and describe how they recognized them. Discuss: What does it mean to recognize a pattern? How do our brains do it? Lead to the idea of AI mimicking this ability.
    *   **Main Activity 1: "What is AI in Data Analysis? - The Intelligent Assistant" (25 mins):**
        *   Introduce a simplified definition of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in data analysis: "Using computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence when working with data, such as recognizing patterns, learning from data, and making predictions or decisions."
        *   Emphasize that AI is not magic, but algorithms and computer programs designed to process data in sophisticated ways.
        *   Focus on AI as a *tool* to assist data scientists, not replace them.
        *   Explain the concept of Pattern Recognition:  AI algorithms can be trained to identify complex patterns, relationships, and anomalies in data that might be difficult or impossible for humans to detect manually, especially in large datasets.
        *   Examples of AI pattern recognition in science:

Students will learn the basic principles of building predictive models, understand key terminology, and ideally get hands-on experience with a visual, user-friendly predictive modelling tool (if feasible and accessible).
*   **Activities:**
    *   **Warm-Up (10 mins):** "Prediction Scenarios" - Present several everyday prediction scenarios (e.g., weather forecast, predicting sports game outcome, predicting traffic congestion, predicting movie box office success). For each scenario, ask students: "What information or data do you think is used to make this prediction? What is being predicted?" Discuss the idea of using data to make predictions.
    *   **Main Activity 1: "What is Predictive Modelling? - Looking into the Crystal Ball" (25 mins):**
        *   Introduce the concept of Predictive Modelling: "Using data and algorithms to build models that can predict future outcomes or unknown values based on patterns learned from past data."
        *   Explain the key steps in building a predictive model (simplified, conceptual level):
            *   **Training the Model:**  The model "learns" patterns and relationships from a dataset called the "training data."  This is like teaching a computer to recognize patterns.
            *   **Features:**  These are the input variables or characteristics used to make predictions (e.g., in weather prediction: temperature, humidity, wind speed; in predicting house price: size, location, number of bedrooms).
            *   **Target Variable:** This is the variable we want to predict (e.g., weather: temperature tomorrow; house price: selling price).
            *   **Making Predictions:** Once trained, the model can use new data (features) to predict the target variable for unseen situations.
            *   **Evaluating the Model:**  After building a model, we need to check how accurate its predictions are. This is called "model evaluation."
        *   Use analogies to explain these concepts (e.g., training a dog to recognize commands, learning from examples in a textbook).
        *   Examples of Predictive Modelling in Science:
            *   **Weather Forecasting:** Predicting future weather conditions based on current and past weather data.
            *   **Disease Prediction in Medicine:** Predicting patient risk of developing a disease based on medical history, genetics, lifestyle data.
            *   **Predicting Species Distribution in Ecology:** Predicting where different species are likely to be found based on environmental factors and species occurrence data.
    *   **Main Activity 2: "Hands-on Predictive Modelling with a Visual Tool (If Feasible)" (20 mins):**
        *   If a simplified, user-friendly visual predictive modelling tool is available and suitable for Year 8 (e.g., a drag-and-drop online tool, or a very basic feature in a data visualization platform), guide students to use it for a simple predictive modelling task.
        *   Example task: Predicting house prices based on features like size and location (using a simplified dataset and tool).
        *   Steps (if using a visual tool):
            *   Load a simplified dataset into the tool.
            *   Identify features (input variables) and target variable (output to predict).
            *   Use the tool's interface to "train" a basic predictive model.
            *   Use the trained model to make predictions for new data points.
            *   Evaluate the model's performance (if the tool provides any basic evaluation metrics).
        *   If a visual tool is not feasible, demonstrate a very simplified predictive modelling example conceptually using a simple dataset and a basic rule or pattern that could be used for prediction.
    *   **Reflection & Discussion (10 mins):** Class discussion:

*   **Activities:**
    *   **Warm-Up (10 mins):** "Ethical Dilemma Scenarios (General)" - Present a few short ethical dilemma scenarios that are not directly related to AI but introduce the concept of ethical decision-making and trade-offs (e.g., a scenario about resource allocation, a scenario about honesty vs. loyalty). Discuss: What are the ethical issues in this scenario? Are there different perspectives on what is "right"? How do you make an ethical decision when there are competing values? Lead to the idea of ethical considerations being complex and important.
    *   **Main Activity 1: "Bias in AI - Unintended Consequences" (25 mins):**
        *   Introduce the concept of Bias in AI: "AI systems can unintentionally learn and perpetuate biases that exist in the data they are trained on, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes."
        *   Explain potential sources of bias in AI:
            *   **Data Bias:** Biases present in the training data itself (e.g., historical data reflecting societal biases, underrepresentation of certain groups in datasets).
            *   **Algorithm Bias:** Biases introduced by the design of the AI algorithm itself (less common but possible).
            *   **Human Bias:** Biases of the people who design, develop, and deploy AI systems.
        *   Examples of AI Bias and its consequences:
            *   **Facial Recognition Bias:** AI facial recognition systems being less accurate in recognizing faces of people with darker skin tones due to biased training data. (Show visual examples if appropriate and sensitive).
            *   **Hiring Algorithm Bias:** AI hiring tools inadvertently discriminating against certain demographic groups based on patterns learned from biased historical hiring data.
            *   **Loan Application Bias:** AI loan approval systems showing bias against certain groups, perpetuating existing inequalities.
        *   "Bias Detection Challenge": Present simplified scenarios or short descriptions of AI systems. Ask students to identify potential sources of bias and possible consequences of biased outcomes in each scenario. Discuss: How can we detect and mitigate bias in AI systems?
    *   **Main Activity 2: "Data Privacy and Transparency in AI" (20 mins):**
        *   Discuss Data Privacy Concerns in AI: AI systems often rely on large amounts of personal data.  It's crucial to consider how this data is collected, used, stored, and protected.  Discuss issues like:
            *   Informed consent for data collection.
            *   Anonymization and de-identification of data.
            *   Data security and preventing data breaches.
            *   Potential for misuse of personal data.
        *   Explain the importance of Transparency and Explainability in AI, especially in critical applications (e.g., healthcare, justice). "Black Box" AI systems (where it's hard to understand how they make decisions) can raise ethical concerns.  Transparency means making AI systems more understandable and explainable.
        *   Examples of ethical considerations related to privacy and transparency:
            *   **Use of AI in Healthcare Diagnosis:**  Ethical need for transparency and explainability in AI diagnostic tools so doctors and patients can understand the reasoning behind AI recommendations.
            *   **AI in Criminal Justice (Risk Assessment Tools):**  Ethical concerns about using "black box" AI algorithms to assess criminal risk without transparency about how these algorithms work and potential biases.
            *   **Data Collection for AI Surveillance Systems:**  Ethical considerations around privacy and potential for misuse of large-scale AI-powered surveillance.
        *   "Ethical AI Principles Brainstorm": In groups, students brainstorm a list of ethical principles or guidelines that should be followed when developing and using AI in data science to address issues of bias, privacy, and transparency. Share and discuss principles as a class.
    *   **Reflection & Discussion (10 mins):** Class discussion:
        *   Why are ethical considerations so important in the field of AI and data science?
        *   What are the potential harms or negative consequences of unethical AI development and use?
        *   What steps can data scientists, developers, and society take to promote ethical AI and mitigate risks of bias, privacy violations, and lack of transparency?
        *   What role do you think you, as future data-literate citizens, can play in ensuring AI is used ethically and responsibly?
