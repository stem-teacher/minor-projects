# Year 8 Term 4

## Weeks 1–10
*Unit:* How can data be manipulated?
*Focus area:* Data Science 1

Students broaden their understanding of how data is used in science, including in the development of scientific models (for example, predicting movement of celestial objects and weather patterns). They build on their problem-solving skills by proposing solutions and recognising data that supports or refutes identified predictions. Students explore diverse data sources and their practical uses, ranging from experimental and big data to digital technology. By recognising the significance of responsible online engagement, students learn to assess the digital footprint generated by various online activities. They learn that data science integrates statistics, scientific methods, algorithms and systems to extract insights from data. Students study scientific models, recognising them as representations of real-world phenomena. They identify model types utilised by scientists, assess data, and make predictions. Students explore data-driven processes, formulate investigable questions and analyse data for patterns. Through this content, students develop skills in creating models to explain observable phenomena, enabling them to engage critically with data and scientific representation.
