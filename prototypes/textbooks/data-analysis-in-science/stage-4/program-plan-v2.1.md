Okay, please find below a revised draft of the Year 8 Data Science Program Plan incorporating the suggested improvements.  I have aimed to be explicit about curriculum links, Tufte principles, AI integration, and differentiation strategies within each week's description.

# Revised Year 8 Data Science Program Plan (10 Weeks)

**Curriculum Alignment:** This program is explicitly aligned with NSW Stage 4 outcomes in Science and Mathematics, addressing:
* **Science:** SC4-DA1-01 (explaining data use in scientific modelling and prediction), SC4-WS-06 (using data to identify trends, patterns, relationships, and draw conclusions), SC4-WS-07 (identifying problem-solving strategies and proposing solutions).
* **Mathematics:** MA4-DAT-C-01 (data classification and visualization), MA4-DAT-C-02 (data analysis using measures of center and spread).

This plan ensures a logical progression, building from foundational numeracy to sophisticated data analysis and visualization, integrating computational methods (Python coding and D3.js) in an accessible manner.  It emphasizes the **evidence-based nature of data science**, drawing on Lord Kelvin’s principle: *"If you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it. When you can measure what you speak about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind."*  This principle of measurement for understanding and improvement underpins the entire program.

**Overview:** Over 10 weeks (three 1-hour lessons per week), students will develop data literacy and analysis skills using both non-digital and digital tools.  Early weeks establish fundamental skills in understanding, collecting, and representing data accurately and precisely. Mid-term, students transition to digital spreadsheets and a constrained coding environment (React-based workbooks with Python) for data analysis. Later weeks introduce D3.js for interactive data visualisation, empowering students to create compelling data stories. Throughout, lessons incorporate real-world data examples, case studies, and a mini data project serving as a summative assessment.  **Differentiation strategies** are embedded to support English as an Additional Language or Dialect (EAL/D) learners, neurodiverse learners, gifted/advanced students, and struggling learners, ensuring equitable engagement and success for all.  An **AI-guided virtual tutor** will provide interactive support, and **AI-based review mechanisms** will ensure continuous curriculum improvement.
