---

## Contextual Alignment and Constraints (from provided curriculum materials):

The teaching sequence must explicitly embed and reference the following curriculum specifications/outcomes from "Curriculum Overview: Data Science 1":

A student:

- Explains how data is used by scientists to model and predict scientific phenomena (SC4-DA1-01)
- Uses data to identify trends, patterns, relationships, and draw conclusions (SC4-WS-06)
- Identifies problem-solving strategies and proposes solutions (SC4-WS-07)

Ensure it explicitly addresses:

- Working Scientifically (Analysing data and information, solving problems).
- Collecting, using, analysing datasets systematically with an emphasis on accuracy, validity, precision.
- Clear understanding of scientific modeling (importance, types, development processes, and real-world applications).
- Practical emphasis on experimental data handling, digital literacy and understanding digital footprints online.

---

## Preferred Pedagogical Approach:

- Strong emphasis on the evidence-based nature of data science. Highlight clearly Lord Kelvin’s concept regarding measurement and evidence:

  > "If you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it. When you can measure what you speak about, express it in numbers, you know something about it; if you cannot measure it, your knowledge is meagre and unsatisfactory.”

- Incremental building of numeric and data literacy, from basic numerical understanding to accurate, precise statistical interpretations.
- Scaffold students’ progression from simple (paper-based/calculator-driven) data collection and analysis to sophisticated digital workbook supported computational tools.

# Year 8 Data Science Program Plan (10 Weeks)

Curriculum Alignment: This program is aligned with NSW Stage 4 outcomes in Mathematics and Science. In particular, it addresses Stage 4 Science Outcome SC4-DA1-01 (explaining how data is used by scientists for modeling and prediction ￼) and Stage 4 Mathematics Statistics & Probability outcomes MA4-DAT-C-01 (data classification and visualization ￼) and MA4-DAT-C-02 (data analysis using measures of center and spread ￼). The plan ensures a logical progression from basic numeracy to data analysis and visualization, gradually introducing computational methods (Python coding and D3.js) in an accessible way.

Overview: Over 10 weeks (three 1-hour lessons per week), students will develop data literacy and analysis skills using both non-digital and digital tools. Early weeks build fundamental skills in understanding and representing data. Mid-term, students learn to use spreadsheets and a constrained coding environment (React-based workbooks instead of Jupyter notebooks) to analyze data with simple Python scripts. Later weeks introduce D3.js for interactive data visualisation. Throughout, lessons incorporate real-world data examples and a mini data project that serves as a summative assessment. Differentiation strategies are embedded to support English as an Additional Language or Dialect (EAL/D) learners and neurodiverse learners, ensuring all students can engage with the material.

Week 1: Introduction to Data & Numerical Literacy

Overview: Students are introduced to the concept of data and its importance. They explore different types of data (categorical vs numerical) and practice basic numerical literacy in context (e.g. interpreting percentages and totals). Learning objectives: Identify and classify data types; understand how data is used in everyday life (including by scientists); reinforce basic math skills needed for data analysis.

Lesson breakdown:
	•	Lesson 1: What is Data? – Brainstorm examples of data in real life (sports stats, weather, etc.) and discuss how scientists use data (e.g. weather forecasting) ￼. Introduce categorical vs numerical data with examples.
	•	Lesson 2: Collecting and Classifying Data – The class conducts a simple survey (e.g. favorite fruit or number of siblings). Students tally results and sort data into categories or numeric ranges. Non-digital activity: create a human bar graph or use sticky notes on the board to represent survey results.
	•	Lesson 3: Basic Numeracy in Data – Using the collected data, students practice calculating totals, differences, and simple percentages (e.g. what percentage of the class chose each category). They interpret a simple infographic or chart, reinforcing reading of scales and percentages.

Hands-on Activities: Class survey and sorting activity (physical grouping of data points); manual calculation of percentages with guidance; interpreting real-world data examples (infographic analysis in pairs).

Formative Assessment: Teacher observation during the survey (noting if students can distinguish categories vs numbers). Questioning after Lesson 1 to check understanding of data types. An exit ticket asking students to give one example of numerical data and one of categorical data ensures comprehension.

Summative Assessment Connections: Establishes foundational knowledge for the term project – students will later collect/interpret data, so understanding data types and basic math is crucial. This week’s survey could seed ideas for the final data investigation.

Differentiation (EAL/D & Neurodiverse): Use visual aids and real objects to illustrate data categories for EAL/D students. Provide a bilingual glossary for key terms (data, survey, category). For neurodiverse learners, offer a clear structure for activities (e.g. a step-by-step checklist for the survey task). Allow students to respond orally or with drawings if writing is a challenge. Pair EAL/D students with supportive buddies during the survey to facilitate communication.

Week 2: Data Representation and Visualization Basics

Overview: Students learn fundamental ways to represent data visually. They create and interpret simple charts by hand and with digital tools. Learning objectives: Construct basic data visualisations (bar charts, pie charts, line graphs) appropriate to different data types; interpret information from these graphs; understand the importance of accurate labels and scales.

Lesson breakdown:
	•	Lesson 1: Representing Categorical Data – Students use last week’s survey data to draw a bar chart on paper (each group takes one data set). They learn about titles, axes, and labels. The class discusses which chart types fit categorical data (bar chart, pie chart for proportions).
	•	Lesson 2: Representing Numerical Data – Introduction to continuous data representation (e.g. a line graph of temperatures over a week, or a dot plot). Teacher provides a small numerical dataset (like daily temperatures or students’ heights) and demonstrates plotting a line graph on graph paper. Students practice creating a dot plot or column graph for a given dataset.
	•	Lesson 3: Interpreting Graphs – Students rotate through stations with different graph examples (bar, line, pie), including one misleading graph. In each station, they answer questions about the data story the graph tells. Class debrief focuses on interpreting key features and spotting issues (e.g. truncated axes).

Hands-on Activities: Drawing charts by hand in groups (using rulers, graph paper); optional digital extension – input the same data into a simple online graphing tool or Excel to compare results. Graph interpretation carousel with prepared posters or printouts.

Formative Assessment: Check student-drawn charts for accuracy (are axes labeled, data correctly plotted). Use questioning during the station rotation to gauge interpretation skills (e.g. “What does this trend tell us?”). A quick quiz at end of the week can ask students to match data types to appropriate graph types.

Summative Assessment Connections: Mastery of graphing skills will be needed when students present findings in their final project. This week’s practice with creating and reading graphs prepares them to design effective visualizations for their own data later in the term. This aligns with the Stage 4 outcome on data visualization (displaying data using various graphical representations) ￼.

Differentiation (EAL/D & Neurodiverse): Provide sentence stems for graph interpretation (“The graph shows that…”). EAL/D students receive dual-language word banks for terms like increase, decrease, trend. Use color coding and icons on graphs to aid comprehension. Neurodiverse students benefit from a template for graph drawing (pre-drawn axes) and the option to type answers instead of writing by hand during interpretation tasks.

Week 3: Descriptive Statistics – Measures of Center and Spread

Overview: Students learn to summarize data using statistical measures. They calculate mean, median, mode (center) and range (spread) for various datasets, understanding what each measure represents. Learning objectives: Compute measures of central tendency and range; compare these measures and recognize how outliers or distribution shape can influence them; describe a dataset using summary statistics.

Lesson breakdown:
	•	Lesson 1: Mean, Median, Mode – Teacher demonstrates how to calculate mean, median, and mode with a simple example (e.g. test scores). Students practice in pairs on prepared data sets (e.g. ages of family members). Discuss situations where each measure is most appropriate.
	•	Lesson 2: Range and Data Spread – Introduce range as a measure of spread. Students find the range in the same datasets. Discuss what range tells us and identify any outliers. Extension discussion on distribution shape (e.g. symmetric vs skewed) in qualitative terms, connecting to how mean vs median behaves.
	•	Lesson 3: Analyzing Data Using Statistics – Given two small data sets (e.g. pulse rates before and after exercise, or temperatures in two cities), students calculate all measures and write a short comparison of the datasets using these statistics. Class shares answers, highlighting how stats summarize differences.

Hands-on Activities: Use physical number cards or linking cubes to find medians (students can line up cards in order to find the middle). Calculators or mental math for computing means. Small-group activity comparing stats of two sets (each group gets a different scenario to analyze and report back).

Formative Assessment: Teacher checks calculations in class (spot-check one group’s work on the board). Quick oral quiz: teacher calls out a small dataset and students respond with the mean or median. Collect the written comparisons from Lesson 3 for feedback (noting if they correctly used terms like “higher average” or “wider range”).

Summative Assessment Connections: These statistical tools will be used in the final project to analyze student-chosen data. Emphasize that understanding mean/median/etc. will allow them to summarize their project findings. This aligns with the curriculum outcome of analyzing datasets using measures of center and range ￼.

Differentiation (EAL/D & Neurodiverse): Provide step-by-step example problems with visuals for EAL/D learners (e.g. a diagram showing how to find the median). Use clear language and avoid idioms when explaining concepts. Allow neurodiverse students to use a calculator or a visual aide (like a number line) if it helps reduce anxiety with arithmetic. Pair students strategically so those who grasp concepts can support those who need more guidance. Offer extra practice sets for reinforcement or extension, as needed per student.

Week 4: Introduction to Spreadsheets for Data Analysis

Overview: Students transition to digital tools by learning basic Excel/Google Sheets skills. They use spreadsheets to organize data, perform calculations (like average), and create simple charts. Learning objectives: Enter and organize data in a spreadsheet; use basic formulas/functions (SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX); generate a chart using software; appreciate how digital tools can streamline data analysis.

Lesson breakdown:
	•	Lesson 1: Spreadsheet Basics – In a computer lab or with devices, students are guided through entering data into a sheet (using a familiar dataset, e.g. class survey results or a provided table of numbers). They practice sorting data and formatting cells (e.g. turning a column of numbers into a list with headings).
	•	Lesson 2: Formulas and Functions – Demonstration of using formulas: sum of a list, average, min, max. Students follow along, computing the mean of their dataset using =AVERAGE(...). They observe how changing a value automatically updates the result (illustrating dynamic calculation).
	•	Lesson 3: Creating Charts Digitally – Teacher shows how to highlight data and insert a chart. Students create a simple bar or line chart from the spreadsheet data. They customize the chart title and labels. If time permits, introduce filtering or using a simple pivot table to show how to summarize data in different ways.

Hands-on Activities: Direct computer work – each student (or pair) uses a spreadsheet to replicate the teacher’s steps. A guided worksheet (digital or paper) provides instructions and space to record the outputs they get (e.g. “What is the average of these numbers?”). Students experiment by changing a data point to see the effect on the average or chart.

Formative Assessment: Monitor students’ screens to ensure they can enter formulas correctly (provide instant feedback if errors like #VALUE! appear). End-of-lesson check: ask students to print or screenshot their chart and submit it for review. Also, a quick exit question: “Name one thing that spreadsheets can do faster than manual calculation.”

Summative Assessment Connections: Proficiency in spreadsheets offers an alternative method for their final project. Students who are less comfortable with coding can use Excel/Sheets to analyze and visualize their project data. Skills from this week (e.g. using AVERAGE function, making charts) directly support the analysis phase of the summative task.

Differentiation (EAL/D & Neurodiverse): Provide written and pictorial step-by-step guides (with screenshots) to accompany the live demonstration – helpful for EAL/D students to follow at their own pace. Allow students to work in pairs so they can support each other (pair an experienced student with one needing guidance). Neurodiverse learners benefit from the structured, repetitive nature of the spreadsheet steps; ensure a quiet workspace or headphones for those sensitive to noise. If a student finds the software interface overwhelming, offer a simplified dataset or even allow them to continue with a familiar manual method as a bridge.

Week 5: Introduction to Programming for Data (Python Basics)

Overview: Students begin using Python to manipulate data, in a highly scaffolded manner. A web-based React workbook environment (with restricted code snippets) is introduced so students can run simple Python code without needing complex setup (an easier approach than full Jupyter notebooks). Learning objectives: Understand the purpose of programming in data science (automation, handling large data sets); run basic Python commands; use variables and simple data structures (like lists) to store data; perform basic calculations in code.

Lesson breakdown:
	•	Lesson 1: Why Code for Data? – Discussion on how coding can automate data analysis (versus doing it by hand or in Excel). Teacher shows a very simple Python script in the workbook that prints a message (e.g. "Hello, Data Science!"). Students run this provided code to see how the environment works. They experiment by changing a value (like printing a different number or message) and re-running.
	•	Lesson 2: Variables and Lists – Introduce the concept of a variable as storage for data. In the workbook, students are given an example: numbers = [4, 8, 6, 2]. They practice modifying the list (adding/changing a number) and then use Python built-in functions to analyze it (e.g. print(len(numbers)), print(sum(numbers))). The teacher explains each step and what the output means.
	•	Lesson 3: Calculations with Python – Students use code to calculate the mean of a list (combining sum() and len(), or using a provided helper function). Introduce a simple loop or condition only if appropriate (e.g. using a loop to find the max value) but keep it optional. The focus is on having students run a sequence of commands that produce a useful result (like “The average is X”).

Hands-on Activities: Interactive coding using the provided React workbook. Each student types and runs code with immediate feedback. A parallel unplugged activity can illustrate coding logic – for example, a pseudocode card sort where students arrange steps to calculate an average (reinforcing the algorithm in plain language before implementing it in Python).

Formative Assessment: The coding platform provides immediate feedback (e.g. error messages if code won’t run). Teacher circulates to troubleshoot errors (syntax mistakes, etc.) and asks students to predict outcomes before running code (“What do you think sum(numbers) will output for our list?”). A short reflection at the end: students write one advantage of using code for data analysis (checked by teacher to ensure they grasp the utility of programming).

Summative Assessment Connections: Coding skills will enable students to handle more complex analysis in their projects (especially if they choose a larger dataset). This week lays the groundwork for using Python to compute statistics or process data for the final project. It also contributes to general computational thinking, which is part of the data science curriculum expectations.

Differentiation (EAL/D & Neurodiverse): The React workbook provides scaffolding (some code is pre-written, with blanks to fill), easing cognitive load. EAL/D students benefit from commented code in simple English and a glossary of programming terms (variable, list, output, etc.). Pair programming can be encouraged – one student writes, the other explains – to build confidence and language skills. Neurodiverse learners who enjoy structure might excel in coding; provide extension tasks (like changing the list data to something of personal interest) for those who grasp the basics quickly. For students who find coding challenging or stressful, allow them to achieve similar tasks in Excel as a fallback (e.g. calculate the average in a spreadsheet) so they still practice the concept in a comfortable way.

Week 6: Applying Python to Data Sets

Overview: Students expand their Python skills to work with larger or more realistic data sets. They practice reading data (provided in code or via a simple input method) and performing analyses such as filtering and summarizing. Mid-week, students begin planning for their own data project by choosing a dataset or topic. Learning objectives: Use Python to perform data analysis tasks (e.g. finding max/min, counting items meeting a condition); compare coding results with spreadsheet results for validation; formulate a plan for a small data investigation (what question to explore and what data is needed).

Lesson breakdown:
	•	Lesson 1: Data Analysis with Code – Using the workbook, students load a prepared dataset (for example, a small list of records provided within the code, so no file handling is required). They run provided code that calculates statistics (mean, etc.) on this dataset. Students then modify the code to answer new questions – for instance, filtering data: “How many values are above 10?” (introducing a for loop or conditional in a guided way). The teacher walks through one example of filtering or finding a max value in code, then lets students attempt a similar task.
	•	Lesson 2: Comparing Methods – Students take a task (such as finding the highest value or average of a dataset) and do it in both Python and Excel. For example, given a dataset of 20 numbers, they use Python code to find the maximum and also use an Excel function (MAX) to find it. This helps solidify understanding and shows that different tools can reach the same result. It also lets students decide which method they prefer for their project.
	•	Lesson 3: Project Planning – The class discusses possible project topics (teacher provides examples: e.g. analyze weather data to spot climate trends, compare statistics of sports players, investigate a social media usage survey, etc.). Students (individually or in small groups) decide on a question to investigate and identify what data they need. They document a brief plan (what question, what data, and how they might analyze it – e.g. Python, Excel, or both). The teacher reviews/approves each plan to ensure it’s feasible and aligned with curriculum goals.

Hands-on Activities: Coding tasks in the workbook (with new functions like loops or conditionals pre-written for students to tweak). Small-group brainstorming for project ideas, possibly using sticky notes or a mind map to outline their plan. Students may also do a quick internet or library search (if allowed) to find a source for data (or the teacher can provide prepared datasets to choose from).

Formative Assessment: Review students’ modified code outputs for correctness (the teacher can quickly run a few tests or have students show their results). The comparison activity itself is a check – if a student’s Python result doesn’t match their spreadsheet result, that flags an issue to address. The project plan proposals are collected or shared verbally; the teacher gives formative feedback on each (ensuring each student has a clear, manageable plan and a source of data identified).

Summative Assessment Connections: By choosing a project topic and data source, students are initiating their summative assessment task. The skills from this week directly feed into how they will conduct their project: they now have the option to use code, spreadsheets, or both to analyze their data. Emphasize that whichever method they choose, the goal is to accurately analyze and draw conclusions from data – echoing the science curriculum focus on using data for explanations/predictions.

Differentiation (EAL/D & Neurodiverse): Provide project idea examples that connect to diverse student interests and backgrounds (e.g. data related to various cultures, popular sports, or environmental issues) to engage all learners. Allow EAL/D students to write project plans in their first language if it helps them articulate their ideas, then discuss in English with support. For the coding part, some students may need to reuse and adapt provided code rather than write new code – that’s okay. Neurodiverse students who prefer routine and clarity might lean towards using Excel (a familiar interface) for the project; that choice should be supported. Conversely, those who are enthusiastic about coding can be given additional guidance to attempt more complex scripts. The key is that each student has a path to success whether through coding or other tools.

Week 7: Introduction to D3.js for Data Visualization

Overview: Students explore interactive data visualization using D3.js within the React workbook. They learn that code can not only analyze data but also display it dynamically in a web page. The approach remains scaffolded – students use a pre-built D3 template to create a visual (e.g. a bar chart) from their data. Learning objectives: Understand the role of D3.js and JavaScript in creating web-based visuals; generate a simple chart using D3 by supplying data and adjusting parameters; compare static vs. interactive visualizations.

Lesson breakdown:
	•	Lesson 1: What is D3.js? – Teacher demonstrates a live interactive visualization (for example, an animated bar chart or an interactive map) to inspire students. Explain in simple terms that D3.js is a JavaScript library for making such web-based charts. In the workbook environment, show the template code for a basic chart and identify key parts (like where the data is inserted, and how axes are defined). Students aren’t expected to understand every line – just the general idea that the code draws a chart based on data.
	•	Lesson 2: Creating a Chart with D3 – Students use the template to plot a simple dataset. For practice, a common dataset is provided (e.g. average monthly temperatures, or the class survey data from Week 1). Students enter the data into the specified section of the code (or upload a small CSV via the interface, if supported) and run it to generate a chart. They tweak one or two parameters (such as bar color or chart title) as directed, to see how changing the code changes the visualization.
	•	Lesson 3: Customizing and Troubleshooting – Students attempt to plug in some of their own project data into the D3 template. The teacher helps them adapt the data format if needed (e.g. ensuring their data is in an array of objects or appropriate structure for the code). They observe the output and troubleshoot any issues (such as overlapping labels or scaling problems). By the end of the lesson, each student or group should have at least one working visual representation of data – either using D3 or, if D3 proves too challenging, a fallback option like an Excel/Google Sheets chart.

Hands-on Activities: Direct interaction with code and visuals – students see immediate feedback as their code generates a picture. A quick non-digital sketching activity can be included: before coding, students draw a rough sketch of what they expect their chart to look like (to plan out axes and labels), then compare with the actual D3 output. A gallery walk at the end of the week allows students to walk around and view each other’s charts on the screens, fostering peer interest and inspiration.

Formative Assessment: Assess students’ ability to generate a chart: the teacher uses a checklist (Did the student correctly input data? Did the chart render correctly?). Ask students to interpret their D3 chart: each should write a caption or brief explanation of what the visualization shows. This checks both their understanding of the visual and their ability to connect it to the data’s meaning. The teacher provides individual feedback on any technical or interpretive issues (e.g. “Your chart is missing a label – how will the audience know what these numbers represent?”).

Summative Assessment Connections: Students now have a powerful tool to create an engaging visualization for their final project. If they succeed with D3, they can include a polished, interactive-style chart in their project presentation, demonstrating higher-order ICT capability. Even if not every student uses D3 in the final submission (some may stick to Excel visuals), the exposure to D3 broadens their understanding of how interactive charts are made, aligning with the curriculum’s push toward advanced data skills. This experience reinforces that data can be communicated visually – a key aspect they will be assessed on in their summative project.

Differentiation (EAL/D & Neurodiverse): Simplify the D3 template code by highlighting or color-coding the parts students need to edit (minimizing extraneous syntax that might confuse them). EAL/D learners get a list of critical code vocabulary (e.g. data, axis, scale) with simple definitions. The teacher might pair a student who has strong coding inclination with an EAL/D student so they can work together on the visualization. Neurodiverse students who find the new coding environment overwhelming can opt to use the tool they are most comfortable with (Excel/Sheets) to create their project chart – the goal of visualizing data can be achieved through multiple means. Conversely, those who thrive on technical challenges can be given an extra task, such as adding a second data series to the chart or a tooltip, with guidance.

Week 8: Project Work – Data Analysis and Visualization

Overview: This week is dedicated to students working on their data science projects, applying skills learned so far. They will analyze their chosen data and begin creating visualizations (using either D3.js or other tools as appropriate). The teacher acts as a facilitator, guiding each project. Learning objectives: Implement a full data analysis process on a self-chosen dataset; create at least one effective chart/visualization of that data; interpret and draw preliminary conclusions from the analysis.

Lesson breakdown:
	•	Lesson 1: Data Analysis in Action – Students ensure their dataset is ready (collected or obtained as per their plan). They spend the lesson computing statistics and looking for patterns: for example, using Python code snippets to calculate means/medians or identify trends in the data, or using Excel to sort data and highlight key values. The teacher checks in with each project group/individual, helping refine their analysis questions or suggesting additional metrics to calculate.
	•	Lesson 2: Visualization in Action – Students focus on producing visual outputs for their project. They create the necessary charts/graphs to showcase their data findings: this could be generating a D3 chart (for those who are comfortable), making graphs in Excel/Google Sheets, or even drawing by hand if the dataset is small and a quick sketch is easier. The goal is for each project to have at least one clear visual that will help explain their results. Peers can pair up to peer-review each other’s charts for clarity and accuracy (e.g. check if axes are labeled, if the chart type suits the data).
	•	Lesson 3: Interpreting Results – Students draft a short summary of what their data shows. They are prompted to consider: “What does this data tell us? What patterns or insights can we see? If applicable, what prediction or decision could someone make based on this data?” (This ties back to the idea of using data to model or predict, as per the science curriculum focus ￼.) They also reflect on whether their initial question was answered or if new questions arose. The teacher holds brief one-on-one conferences with each student/group to ensure they can articulate their findings and are on track for the final presentation.

Hands-on Activities: Primarily project work – hands-on use of tools (coding, spreadsheets, etc.) with teacher guidance. A peer feedback activity is included: during Lesson 2, after charts are created, students exchange laptops or printouts with a partner group to get feedback on their visualizations (each group gives one praise and one constructive suggestion). This collaboration helps improve the quality of the outputs.

Formative Assessment: Ongoing observation and coaching during project work. The teacher uses a project progress checklist to note each student’s status: data obtained (✔), analysis done (partial/complete), visualization created (✔), interpretation drafted (✔). This helps identify who needs extra support. The written summary from Lesson 3 is collected as a draft for the final report/presentation; the teacher provides feedback on clarity, accuracy, and whether the data interpretation is sound (addressing any misinterpretations immediately).

Summative Assessment Connections: By the end of Week 8, most components of the summative project should be in draft form (data analyzed, charts made, conclusions drawn). The focus on articulating what the data shows prepares students for the communication aspect of the summative assessment. Additionally, explicitly prompting predictions or real-world implications of their data addresses Science outcome SC4-DA1-01 – students practice explaining how data can be used to understand or predict phenomena, which they will formally do in their final presentation.

Differentiation (EAL/D & Neurodiverse): Since projects are student-driven, allow flexible formats for analysis notes and summaries (bullet points, concept maps, voice recordings) to suit individual needs. EAL/D students can be permitted to discuss their findings in their native language first to clarify their thoughts, then work on expressing it in English – the teacher can help translate key terms. Provide sentence starters for writing conclusions (e.g. “The data indicates that…”, “One reason for this pattern could be…”). For neurodiverse learners, ensure their project leverages their interests to keep motivation high; provide a visual project checklist or timeline to help them organize tasks. If some students are behind, consider allocating a teacher aide or additional one-on-one time to get them up to speed. Likewise, if a student has excelled and finished early, have them act as a “peer expert” to assist classmates (which can build their communication skills and confidence).

Week 9: Project Finalization and Review

Overview: Students finalize their projects and prepare to communicate their findings. Additionally, the class reviews key concepts learned throughout the term to reinforce understanding and celebrate progress. Learning objectives: Refine data visualizations and analysis for clarity and accuracy; practice presenting data findings in a clear, confident manner; review and consolidate knowledge of data science concepts (graphs, stats, coding basics) in preparation for assessment.

Lesson breakdown:
	•	Lesson 1: Final Touches – Students polish their project deliverables. This may include improving graph aesthetics (adding titles, axis labels, legends where necessary), double-checking calculations for accuracy, and organizing their findings into a presentation format (slides, report, poster, etc. depending on the assignment guidelines). Teachers and peers provide last-minute feedback on content and formatting. By end of this lesson, projects should be complete or nearly complete.
	•	Lesson 2: Practice Presentations – Each student or group does a short run-through of their presentation or an explanation of their project to a partner or small group. They practice telling the “story” of their data: what their question was, how they approached it, and what they found. Peers listening act as an audience and ask one or two questions. This gives presenters a chance to refine their clarity and think about how to answer questions on the spot. The teacher floats among groups to observe and coach on presentation skills (voice volume, eye contact, clarity of explanations).
	•	Lesson 3: Concept Review Game – The teacher leads a fun review of the term’s key concepts. This could be a quiz game (e.g. a Kahoot or Jeopardy-style game) covering important terms and skills from the unit: types of graphs, meanings of mean/median, interpreting a snippet of code, etc. Students work in teams to answer questions, reinforcing their learning in a lively way. Finally, the teacher highlights how far they’ve come (from basic data concepts to carrying out a full project) to build confidence and acknowledge their hard work.

Hands-on Activities: Creating and tweaking presentation materials (hands-on with software like PowerPoint or Canva, or with physical poster-making for a poster presentation). The practice presentation is an interactive speaking/listening activity. The review game is an engaging, competitive activity – students might use devices for an online quiz or physical whiteboards to write answers in teams.

Formative Assessment: Continuous feedback on project elements: the teacher checks each project’s final state against the assessment criteria and gives pointers if something is missing (e.g. “Make sure you mention how you calculated that average” or “This label is hard to read, can you enlarge it?”). The practice presentations serve as a formative assessment of communication skills – the teacher notes common issues (like misuse of a term or an unclear explanation) and addresses them with the class (“I noticed some of us confusing median with mean; let’s clarify that one more time”). Results of the review game can highlight any last areas of confusion, which the teacher can quickly clarify in the moment.

Summative Assessment Connections: By end of this week, students should be fully prepared for the summative assessment. The polished project will be presented or submitted in Week 10 as the major summative task. The review of concepts ensures that if there is an additional individual test or quiz as part of summative evaluation, students are ready for it. This week cements the knowledge and skills that will be formally assessed.

Differentiation (EAL/D & Neurodiverse): Offer multiple presentation formats to accommodate different needs: for example, an EAL/D student might use more visuals and fewer words on slides, or include a short video demonstration if writing English text is challenging; a neurodiverse student with presentation anxiety could be allowed to video-record their presentation at home, or present just to the teacher, as an alternative to a live full-class presentation. During the review game, ensure inclusivity by grouping students so that each team has mixed abilities (so EAL/D students are supported and everyone gets a chance to contribute). Provide a copy of key review questions or vocabulary to students who need more time to process language, allowing them to follow along.

Week 10: Summative Assessment and Reflection

Overview: In the final week, students deliver their completed data science projects and reflect on their learning. This serves as the summative assessment of the unit and an opportunity to celebrate growth. Learning objectives: Present data findings clearly and confidently; demonstrate the ability to explain how data was used to answer a question (linking to real-world modeling/prediction); self-reflect on growth in data skills and understanding.

Lesson breakdown:
	•	Lesson 1: Project Presentations (Part 1) – Half of the class presents their projects to the class (if projects were done in groups, each group presents together; if individual, each student presents). Each presentation includes: the question they investigated, how they collected/gathered their data, key analysis steps (with mention of any tools like Python or Excel used), their main findings with at least one visual (chart), and conclusions or predictions drawn from the data. The audience (peers and teacher) can ask questions after each presentation. The teacher uses a rubric to assess each presentation (looking at criteria such as understanding of data, correctness of analysis, clarity of visualization, and communication skills).
	•	Lesson 2: Project Presentations (Part 2) – The remaining students/groups present. The same format and assessment apply. Students in the audience are encouraged to provide positive peer feedback (e.g. one thing they learned or liked about each presentation) to create a supportive environment.
	•	Lesson 3: Reflection and Closure – After all presentations, the class engages in a reflection session. This might include a short written reflection or a discussion. Possible prompts: “What was the most interesting thing you learned in this data science unit?”, “Which skills do you feel more confident in now than at the start?”, and “How can understanding data help you in other subjects or outside of school?”. The teacher also connects the skills learned to real-world applications one last time (e.g. discussing how data science is used in sports, medicine, environmental science, etc., linking back to the idea of modeling and predicting). Finally, the class celebrates the completion of the program – this could be a fun certificate, showcasing projects on a wall or website, or simply verbal praise highlighting each student’s achievement.

Hands-on Activities: The presentations are a hands-on performance task for students, and listening to peers is active as they have Q&A. The reflection can be hands-on if using sticky notes or journaling. If time and resources allow, a small celebratory activity (like a trivia quiz on fun data facts, or a group photo with their projects) can make the closure memorable.

Formative Assessment: At this stage, most assessment is summative, but the teacher continues to take note of any misconceptions that come up in presentations or discussions and addresses them on the spot. The reflection responses offer insight into student perceptions of their own learning – the teacher reviews these to understand each student’s takeaways and to inform future iterations of the program (this is more for teacher reflection, but also validates each student’s voice).

Summative Assessment: The main summative assessment is the project presentation, which evaluates students on the full range of skills developed (data collection/analysis, visualization, interpretation, and communication). This directly demonstrates that students can “classify, display, and analyze data” as per the math outcomes and can “explain how data is used… to model and predict” an aspect of their chosen topic, fulfilling SC4-DA1-01. If the curriculum or school requires an additional summative test or quiz, it could be administered this week (for example, a short written test on key terms or interpreting a new dataset); however, ideally the project itself serves as the primary summative evidence of learning in this unit.

Differentiation (EAL/D & Neurodiverse): During presentations, allow supportive measures: EAL/D students might use cue cards with key phrases, and the teacher permits them to occasionally read from notes if needed. Visuals in their presentation (charts, images) can help convey ideas if speaking in English is challenging – the focus is on demonstrating understanding, which can be through the visual and data content as much as through spoken language. For neurodiverse students who struggle with public speaking, alternatives can be offered (e.g. presenting to a smaller audience or one-on-one with the teacher, or showing a pre-recorded explanation). Ensure the Q&A portion is positive and encouraging – if a student cannot answer a question on the spot, the teacher can rephrase or provide a hint to scaffold them to the answer, rather than leaving them feeling put on the spot. In the reflection activity, accept different formats (written, drawn, spoken) so that all students can express their thoughts comfortably. The goal is to let every student demonstrate their learning and feel proud of their accomplishments in a supportive atmosphere.

Throughout the program, the progression of skills is clear: students start with fundamental concepts of data and numeracy (Weeks 1–3), build up to using tools and technology for data handling (Weeks 4–7), and finally apply all skills in an independent context (Weeks 8–10). This logical sequence, aligned with NSW curriculum outcomes, ensures students grow from basic data literacy to performing genuine data analysis and creating visualisations. By the end of the 10 weeks, Year 8 students are not only able to “classify, display, and analyze data” ￼ but can also “explain how data is used by scientists to model and predict phenomena” ￼, fulfilling the curriculum’s objectives for Stage 4 Data Science in an engaging and accessible manner.
