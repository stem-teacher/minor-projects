            leave a trace or record behind?" (e.g., social media posts,
            searches, online shopping, website visits, app usage). Write
            these on the board.

        -   Present a short, thought-provoking scenario: "Imagine a
            future employer or university admissions officer is looking
            at your online activity. What kind of picture would your
            digital footprint paint of you? Are there things you would
            want to change or be more mindful of?" Brief class
            discussion.

    -   **Main Activity 1: "Deconstructing the Digital Footprint" (25
        mins):**

            (designed to be more complex and nuanced for selective
            students):

            -   **Scenario 1: Anonymized Medical Data:** Researchers
                have a large dataset of anonymized patient medical
                records for studying disease patterns. Is it ethical to
                use this data without explicit consent, even if
                anonymized? What are the potential benefits and risks?

            -   **Scenario 2: Environmental Monitoring &
                Surveillance:** A city wants to use AI-powered
                surveillance cameras to monitor pollution levels in
                real-time. This data could also be used for general
                public surveillance. What are the ethical trade-offs
                between environmental protection and privacy?

            -   **Scenario 3: AI Bias in Data Analysis:** An AI
                algorithm used to predict student success in science is
                found to be biased against certain demographic groups
                due to biases in the training data. How should this be
                addressed? What are the ethical responsibilities of data
                scientists in mitigating bias?

        -   Small group discussions on each scenario, followed by class
            sharing and debate. Encourage students to consider different

        mins):**

        -   Explicitly define Primary Data (collected firsthand for a
            specific purpose) and Secondary Data (collected by others,
            for other purposes).

        -   Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each data type
            in scientific research (e.g., primary - control, relevance,
            but time-consuming; secondary - readily available, large
            datasets, but potentially less relevant, quality concerns).

        -   Examples of Primary Data Collection Methods: Experiments,
            Surveys, Observations, Simulations. Briefly describe each

        -   Divide students into small groups.

        -   Assign each group one or two scientific questions from the
            warm-up or provide new, more complex scientific questions
            suitable for Year 8 selective students (e.g., related to
            local environmental issues, human behaviour, simple physics
            phenomena).

        -   Each group task: Design a *primary* data collection plan to
            investigate their assigned question. The plan must include:

            -   **Scientific Question (clearly stated).**

            -   **Type of Primary Data Collection Method(s) to be used
                (Experiment, Survey, Observation, Simulation – or
                combination). Justify your choice.**

            -   **Specific Data to be Collected (what variables will you
                measure or observe? Be precise).**

            -   **Brief outline of the Procedure (how will you collect
                the data? What steps will you follow? Consider safety
                and ethical aspects).**

            -   **Data Types (will you collect qualitative,
                quantitative, or both?).**

        -   Groups work on their plans. Teacher circulates to provide
            guidance and feedback, encouraging more rigorous design and
            consideration of potential challenges.

    -   *NSW Curriculum Outcomes:* SC4-WS-06 (Process data and
        information), SC4-WS-07 (Communicate information), SC4-DA1-01
        (Analyse a model to identify data and trends)

-   **Overview:** This lesson introduces bar graphs as a powerful
    visualization tool for comparing categorical data. Students will
    learn the components of bar graphs, practice constructing them, and
    develop skills in interpreting bar graphs to identify comparisons
    and draw conclusions about categorical relationships in scientific
    data.

-   **Activities:**

    -   **Warm-Up (10 mins):** "Categorical Data Brainstorm" - Ask
        students to brainstorm examples of categorical data in science
        and everyday life (e.g., types of animals, colours of flowers,
        types of rocks, favourite subjects, survey responses with
        categories). List these on the board. Discuss: What kind of
        questions can we answer with categorical data? How can we
        visually compare categories?

    -   **Main Activity 1: "Anatomy of a Bar Graph - Building Blocks of
        Comparison" (25 mins):**

        -   Introduce the key components of a bar graph:

            -   **Axes:** Horizontal (x-axis) for categories, Vertical
                (y-axis) for frequency or quantity. Label axes clearly
                (category name, quantity name, units if applicable).

            -   **Bars:** Rectangular bars representing each category.
                Bar height or length corresponds to the frequency or
                quantity for that category. Bars should be visually
                distinct and have appropriate spacing.

            -   **Scale:** Appropriate scale on the y-axis to
                accommodate the data range, with clear tick marks and
                labels.

            -   **Title:** Clear, concise title describing what the bar
                graph represents.

            -   **Labels:** Category labels along the x-axis, and y-axis
                labels with units.

        -   Show examples of well-designed and poorly designed bar
            graphs. For poorly designed examples, ask students to
            identify weaknesses and suggest improvements. Focus on
            clarity, accurate representation of data, and effective
            visual comparison of categories.

        -   Introduce different types of bar graphs:

            -   **Vertical Bar Graph:** Bars extend vertically from the
                x-axis. Common for comparing categories along the
                x-axis.

            -   **Horizontal Bar Graph:** Bars extend horizontally from
                the y-axis. Useful when category labels are long or when

        graph (axes, data points, lines, labels, title, scale).

    -   Students will be able to choose appropriate scales and line
        styles for effective line graph construction.

    -   Students will be able to interpret line graphs to identify
        trends, patterns, and relationships in data over time or a
        continuous variable.

    -   *NSW Curriculum Outcomes:* SC4-WS-06 (Process data and
        information), SC4-WS-07 (Communicate information), SC4-DA1-01
        (Analyse a model to identify data and trends)

-   **Overview:** This lesson introduces line graphs as the primary tool
    for visualizing trends and changes in continuous data, particularly
    over time. Students will learn the components of line graphs,
    practice constructing them, and develop skills in interpreting line
    graphs to identify trends, patterns, and relationships in scientific
    data.

-   **Activities:**

    -   **Warm-Up (10 mins):** "Trend Spotting Challenge" - Show
        students several simple line graphs depicting trends (e.g.,
        temperature changes over a day, population growth over years,
        reaction rate changing with temperature). For each graph, ask:
        "What trend or pattern do you see in this graph? Is it
        increasing, decreasing, fluctuating, stable? What does this
        trend tell you about the data?" Focus on quickly identifying
        visual trends.

    -   **Main Activity 1: "Anatomy of a Line Graph - Connecting the
        Dots of Change" (25 mins):**

        -   Introduce the key components of a line graph:

            -   **Axes:** Horizontal (x-axis) usually for time or a
                continuous independent variable, Vertical (y-axis) for
                the dependent variable being measured. Label axes
                clearly (variable names, units).

            -   **Data Points:** Plotted points representing data values
                for each time point or x-value.

            -   **Lines:** Lines connecting consecutive data points to
                show trends. Use straight lines between points. For
                multiple datasets on the same graph, use different line
                styles or colours to distinguish them.

            -   **Scale:** Appropriate scales for both axes to
                accommodate data ranges, with clear tick marks and
                labels. Choose scales that spread out the data
                effectively and make trends visible.

            -   **Title:** Clear, concise title describing what the line
                graph represents.

            -   **Labels:** Axis labels with variable names and units,
                and potentially a legend if multiple lines are plotted.

        -   Show examples of well-designed and poorly designed line
            graphs. For poorly designed examples, ask students to
            identify weaknesses and suggest improvements. Focus on
            clarity, accurate representation of trends, and effective
            visual communication of change over time.

        -   Discuss choosing appropriate scales for line graphs: linear
            vs. logarithmic (briefly introduce log scale concept for
            future, focus on linear for Year 8). Discuss how scale
            choice can affect the visual appearance of trends.

        -   Discuss line styles: solid lines, dashed lines, dotted lines
            for distinguishing multiple datasets.

    -   **Main Activity 2: "Line Graph Construction Challenge -
        Revealing Time-Based Trends" (20 mins):**

        -   Provide students with datasets suitable for line graphs
            (different datasets for different groups - e.g., temperature
            readings over time, plant growth measurements over weeks,
            reaction rate data at different temperatures, population
            data over years). Data can be in tables or lists.

        -   Each group task: Construct a line graph (using paper and
            pencil initially, or digital tools - spreadsheet software,
            Observable) to visualize their assigned dataset. They need
            to choose appropriate axes, scales, plot data points,
            connect lines, label axes, and add a title. Encourage them
            to focus on creating a clear line graph that effectively
            shows trends and changes over time.
