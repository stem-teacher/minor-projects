\section{The Nature of Science}

\newthought{Science} is a systematic way of investigating the natural world. It involves observing phenomena, asking questions, and gathering evidence to develop explanations.
\marginnote{The word "science" comes from the Latin word "scientia," meaning knowledge.}

\keyword{Science} can be defined as both a body of knowledge and a process for building that knowledge. As a body of knowledge, science includes all the facts, theories, and laws that describe the natural world. As a process, science involves observation, questioning, hypothesizing, testing, and refining theories.

\historylink{Humans have been practicing forms of science for thousands of years, but modern scientific methods developed primarily during the Scientific Revolution (1500s-1700s).}

\subsection{Characteristics of Science}

What makes science different from other ways of understanding the world?

\begin{keyconcept}{Key Characteristics of Science}
\begin{description}
    \item[Evidence-based] Scientific claims must be supported by observable evidence.
    \item[Testable] Scientific ideas can be tested through experiments or observations.
    \item[Tentative] Scientific knowledge is always open to revision with new evidence.
    \item[Explanatory] Science seeks to explain how and why things happen.
    \item[Predicitve] Scientific theories allow us to make predictions about future events.
    \item[Objective] Scientists strive to minimize personal bias in their investigations.
    \item[Public] Scientific knowledge is shared through publications and peer review.
\end{description}
\end{keyconcept}

\challenge{Choose a pseudoscience (like astrology or crystal healing) and research how it differs from true science based on the characteristics above.}

\section{Scientific Method and Process}

\newthought{The scientific method} is a flexible framework that guides scientific investigations. While there's no single "correct" way to do science, most scientific investigations follow a general pattern.

\subsection{Steps in Scientific Investigation}

\begin{keyconcept}{The Scientific Method}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Ask a question} based on observations or curiosity
    \item \textbf{Research} what is already known about the topic
    \item \textbf{Formulate a hypothesis} (a testable explanation)
    \item \textbf{Design and conduct an experiment} to test the hypothesis
    \item \textbf{Collect and analyze data} from the experiment
    \item \textbf{Draw conclusions} based on the evidence
    \item \textbf{Communicate results} to the scientific community
    \item \textbf{Refine, retest, or ask new questions} based on findings
\end{enumerate}
\end{keyconcept}

% \begin{marginfigure}
%     \centering
%     \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{scientificmethod.png}
%     \caption{The scientific method as a cycle, emphasizing that science is an ongoing process rather than a linear progression.}
% \end{marginfigure}

It's important to understand that real scientific research rarely follows these steps in a simple, linear fashion. Scientists often revise their methods, return to earlier steps, or take different approaches depending on what they discover.

\mathlink{Variables in experiments need to be carefully controlled. If testing how light affects plant growth, you'd need to keep all other factors (water, soil, temperature) constant.}

\subsection{Forming a Scientific Hypothesis}

A \keyword{hypothesis} is a proposed explanation for an observation or phenomenon that can be tested through experimentation.

A good scientific hypothesis:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Is testable (can be investigated through experiments)
    \item Makes specific predictions
    \item Is falsifiable (could potentially be proven wrong)
    \item Is based on existing knowledge
\end{itemize}

Hypotheses are often written in "If... then..." format:

\begin{example}
"If plants need light to grow, then plants kept in darkness will grow less than plants kept in light."
\end{example}

\historylink{The concept of falsifiability was developed by philosopher Karl Popper, who argued that what makes a theory scientific is that it can potentially be proven false through testing.}

\begin{investigation}{Creating Testable Hypotheses}
\textbf{Purpose:} Practice recognizing and creating testable scientific hypotheses.

\textbf{Activity:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item For each statement below, determine whether it is a testable scientific hypothesis. If not, explain why and try to revise it into a testable hypothesis.
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Plants grow better with classical music than with rock music.
        \item The ocean is beautiful.
        \item Dinosaurs were the coolest animals ever.
        \item Students who eat breakfast perform better on morning tests than students who skip breakfast.
        \item Heavier objects fall faster than lighter objects.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Now create your own testable hypothesis about something in your everyday life. Remember to use the "If... then..." format and ensure it's specific and falsifiable.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Discussion:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What makes a statement scientific versus non-scientific?
    \item Why is it important for scientific hypotheses to be falsifiable?
    \item How could you design an experiment to test your hypothesis?
\end{enumerate}
\end{investigation}

\section{Laboratory Safety}

\newthought{Safety is paramount} in scientific investigations. Before conducting any experiment, it's essential to understand and follow safety guidelines.

\subsection{General Safety Rules}

\begin{keyconcept}{Laboratory Safety Rules}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as safety goggles, lab coat, and gloves when necessary.
    
    \item Know the location of safety equipment (fire extinguisher, eyewash station, first aid kit) and emergency exits.
    
    \item Never eat, drink, or chew gum in the laboratory.
    
    \item Tie back long hair and secure loose clothing.
    
    \item Read all instructions before beginning an experiment.
    
    \item Never work alone in the laboratory.
    
    \item Report all accidents and spills immediately to your teacher.
    
    \item Clean up your work area and wash your hands thoroughly after completing experiments.
    
    \item Never smell chemicals directly—use the wafting technique.
    
    \item Handle glassware carefully and report any breakages.
    
    \item Never conduct unauthorized experiments.
\end{enumerate}
\end{keyconcept}

%     \caption{Common laboratory safety symbols and their meanings.}
% \end{marginfigure}

\subsection{Understanding Safety Symbols}

Laboratory chemicals and equipment often have safety symbols that indicate potential hazards. It's important to recognize and understand these symbols before working with any materials.

\begin{investigation}{Laboratory Safety Scavenger Hunt}
\textbf{Purpose:} Familiarize yourself with safety equipment and procedures in your science classroom.

\textbf{Materials:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Laboratory safety checklist (provided by your teacher)
    \item Clipboard and pen
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Procedure:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Work in pairs to locate and identify each safety item on your checklist.
    \item For each item, note its location and briefly explain its purpose.
    \item Identify safety symbols found in the laboratory and explain what they mean.
    \item Create a simple map of the laboratory showing the locations of key safety equipment.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Discussion:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Why is it important to know the location of safety equipment before conducting experiments?
    \item What should you do if an accident occurs in the laboratory?
    \item How does proper preparation help prevent laboratory accidents?
\end{enumerate}
\end{investigation}

\section{Scientific Skills}

\newthought{Scientific investigations} require a range of skills, from careful observation to precise measurement and data analysis.

\subsection{Observation Skills}

\keyword{Observation} is the act of carefully watching and recording information using your senses. Scientific observations should be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Accurate and precise
    \item Objective (factual, not opinion-based)
    \item Detailed and thorough
    \item Recorded systematically
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}
Non-scientific observation: "The liquid is really pretty."
Scientific observation: "The liquid is transparent with a blue tint, has no visible particles, and is approximately 20 mL in volume."
\end{example}

\subsection{Measurement Skills}

Accurate \keyword{measurement} is essential in scientific investigations. Scientists use standardized units from the International System of Units (SI) to ensure consistency and reproducibility.

\begin{keyconcept}{Common SI Units in Science}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Length:} meter (m)
    \item \textbf{Mass:} kilogram (kg)
    \item \textbf{Time:} second (s)
    \item \textbf{Temperature:} Kelvin (K) or degrees Celsius (°C)
    \item \textbf{Volume:} cubic meter (m³) or liter (L)
    \item \textbf{Force:} newton (N)
    \item \textbf{Energy:} joule (J)
\end{itemize}
\end{keyconcept}

\mathlink{When taking measurements, it's important to understand significant figures—the number of digits that carry meaning. For example, if a ruler has millimeter markings, you can report length to the nearest 0.1 cm.}

% \begin{marginfigure}
%     \centering
%     \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{measurement.png}
%     \caption{Reading a graduated cylinder at eye level to accurately measure volume. The bottom of the meniscus (curved surface) is used for the reading.}
% \end{marginfigure}

\subsection{Data Collection and Recording}

Scientists record data systematically using tables, diagrams, photographs, and written descriptions. Good record-keeping practices include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Dating all entries
    \item Recording data immediately (not from memory)
    \item Using clear, consistent formats
    \item Including units of measurement
    \item Noting any unexpected observations or equipment issues
\end{itemize}

\begin{investigation}{Practicing Observation and Measurement}
\textbf{Purpose:} Develop skills in scientific observation and measurement.

\textbf{Materials:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Various small objects (leaves, rocks, coins, etc.)
    \item Rulers, measuring tapes
    \item Balance or scale
    \item Thermometer
    \item Magnifying glass
    \item Data recording sheet
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Procedure:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Select an object and make detailed qualitative observations (color, texture, shape, etc.).
    \item Make quantitative measurements of your object (dimensions, mass, temperature if appropriate).
    \item Create detailed sketches or diagrams of your object, labeling key features.
    \item Organize your observations and measurements in a data table.
    \item Exchange objects with a classmate and repeat the process.
    \item Compare your observations and measurements with your classmate's for the same object.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Discussion:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How similar or different were your observations compared to your classmate's?
    \item What was challenging about making precise observations and measurements?
    \item How could your observation and measurement techniques be improved?
    \item Why is it important for scientists to record both qualitative and quantitative data?
\end{enumerate}
\end{investigation}

\section{Understanding Variables and Controls}

\newthought{Scientific experiments} are designed to investigate the relationship between variables. Understanding different types of variables is essential for designing valid experiments.

\subsection{Types of Variables}

\begin{keyconcept}{Types of Variables}
\begin{description}
    \item[Independent variable] The factor that is changed or manipulated by the experimenter.
    \item[Dependent variable] The factor that is measured or observed to see how it responds to the independent variable.
    \item[Controlled variables] Factors that are kept constant to ensure a fair test.
\end{description}
\end{keyconcept}

% \begin{marginfigure}
%     \centering
%     \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{variables.png}
%     \caption{Relationship between independent, dependent, and controlled variables in an experiment.}
% \end{marginfigure}

\begin{example}
In an experiment to test how fertilizer affects plant growth:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Independent variable: Amount of fertilizer
    \item Dependent variable: Plant height or mass
    \item Controlled variables: Type of plant, amount of water, amount of sunlight, temperature, soil type
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

\subsection{Controls in Experiments}

A \keyword{control group} is a group in an experiment that does not receive the experimental treatment but is otherwise treated exactly the same as the experimental group. Controls allow scientists to verify that observed effects are due to the independent variable and not some other factor.

\historylink{The concept of controlled experiments was developed in the 11th century by Persian scientist Ibn al-Haytham, considered by many to be the father of the modern scientific method.}

\begin{investigation}{Designing a Controlled Experiment}
\textbf{Purpose:} Practice identifying variables and designing a controlled experiment.

\textbf{Scenario:} You want to test whether the type of water (tap water, bottled water, or saltwater) affects seed germination.

\textbf{Task:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify the independent variable, dependent variable, and at least three variables that need to be controlled.
    
    \item Design an experiment to test your hypothesis. Your experimental design should include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A clear hypothesis
        \item Materials needed
        \item Step-by-step procedure
        \item How you will measure results
        \item How you will ensure the experiment is fair and controlled
        \item A data table for recording results
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Explain why a control group is necessary for this experiment and what your control group would be.
    
    \item Identify possible sources of error in your experimental design and how they might be minimized.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Extension:} If time and resources allow, conduct your experiment and compare your actual results with your predictions.
\end{investigation}

\challenge{Design an experiment to test whether music affects plant growth. Identify your variables, describe your controls, and explain how you would measure and analyze your results. Consider potential ethical issues that might arise.}

\section{Analyzing and Interpreting Data}

\newthought{After collecting data}, scientists must analyze and interpret it to draw conclusions and answer their original research questions.

\subsection{Data Analysis Techniques}

Data analysis often involves:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Organizing data in tables and graphs
    \item Calculating statistics (mean, median, range, etc.)
    \item Identifying patterns, trends, and relationships
    \item Comparing results to predictions
    \item Assessing the reliability and validity of data
\end{itemize}

\mathlink{The mean (average) is calculated by adding all values and dividing by the number of values. The median is the middle value when all values are arranged in order. The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values.}

\subsection{Creating and Interpreting Graphs}

Graphs visually represent data, making patterns and trends easier to identify. Common types of graphs include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Bar graphs:} Compare discrete categories
    \item \textbf{Line graphs:} Show changes over time or continuous relationships
    \item \textbf{Scatter plots:} Display the relationship between two variables
    \item \textbf{Pie charts:} Show proportions of a whole
\end{itemize}

% \begin{marginfigure}
%     \centering
%     \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{graphs.png}
%     \caption{Examples of different types of graphs used in science.}
% \end{marginfigure}

When creating graphs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Always include a title
    \item Label axes with variables and units
    \item Use appropriate scales
    \item Include a legend if necessary
    \item Keep the design clean and clear
\end{itemize}

\begin{investigation}{Analyzing and Graphing Scientific Data}
\textbf{Purpose:} Practice analyzing and graphing scientific data to identify patterns and draw conclusions.

\textbf{Scenario:} A scientist conducted an experiment to test how the height of a ramp affects the distance a toy car travels. The results are shown in the table below:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Ramp Height (cm)} & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{\textbf{Distance Traveled (cm)}} & \textbf{Average Distance (cm)} \\
\cline{2-4}
 & \textbf{Trial 1} & \textbf{Trial 2} & \textbf{Trial 3} & \\
\hline
5 & 28 & 30 & 26 & \\
\hline
10 & 58 & 54 & 60 & \\
\hline
15 & 82 & 85 & 79 & \\
\hline
20 & 108 & 112 & 106 & \\
\hline
25 & 135 & 130 & 137 & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Tasks:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Calculate the average distance traveled for each ramp height.
    
    \item Create a line graph of the data with ramp height on the x-axis and average distance traveled on the y-axis.
    
    \item Analyze the data and graph to answer these questions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What pattern do you observe in the relationship between ramp height and distance traveled?
        \item Is the relationship linear or non-linear?
        \item Based on the pattern, predict how far the car would travel with a ramp height of 30 cm.
        \item What factors might cause variations in the results between trials?
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Write a conclusion for this experiment, relating your findings to potential energy, kinetic energy, and friction.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Extension:} Design your own experiment to test another factor that might affect the distance traveled by the toy car (e.g., car weight, surface type).
\end{investigation}

\section{Drawing Conclusions and Communicating Results}

\newthought{The final steps} in scientific investigation involve drawing conclusions based on data and communicating results to others.

    \item[Openness] Sharing methods and data with the scientific community
    \item[Respect] Treating human and animal subjects with dignity
    \item[Responsibility] Considering the broader impacts of research
\end{description}
\end{keyconcept}

\historylink{The Nuremberg Code, established in 1947 after World War II, was one of the first sets of ethical guidelines for research involving human subjects, created in response to unethical Nazi medical experiments.}

\subsection{Ethical Considerations in Scientific Research}

Scientists must consider ethical questions such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Is the research beneficial to society or the environment?
    \item Are human or animal subjects treated humanely?
    \item Are potential risks minimized?
    \item Have participants given informed consent?
    \item Is the research conducted safely and responsibly?
    \item Are potential environmental impacts addressed?
\end{itemize}

\begin{investigation}{Ethical Case Studies in Science}
\textbf{Purpose:} Explore ethical issues in scientific research and develop ethical reasoning skills.

\textbf{Activity:} Review the following ethical scenarios and discuss the ethical considerations involved:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Scenario 1:} A scientist finds that their experimental results don't support their hypothesis. They're considering running additional trials until they get the results they expected or adjusting their data slightly to show a clearer trend.
    
    \item \textbf{Scenario 2:} Researchers want to test a new wildlife tracking device. The device is attached to animals' ears and provides valuable data about migration patterns, but may cause minor discomfort to the animals.
    
    \item \textbf{Scenario 3:} A team of scientists develops a genetically modified crop that grows faster and produces more food, but there are uncertainties about its long-term environmental impacts.
    
    \item \textbf{Scenario 4:} A pharmaceutical company has developed a drug that could help many people, but it would be very expensive. They need to decide whether to make the drug more affordable at the cost of reducing their profits.
\end{enumerate}

For each scenario, discuss:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What ethical principles are involved?
    \item Who could be affected by the decisions made?
    \item What would be the most ethical course of action and why?
    \item What additional information would help make a better decision?
