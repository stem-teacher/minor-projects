\chapter{Properties of Matter (Particle Theory)}

\section*{Chapter Overview}

\begin{quote}
    In this chapter, you will explore the fundamental nature of matter—the stuff that makes up everything around us. You'll learn about the particle theory of matter and how it explains the properties of solids, liquids, and gases. Through hands-on investigations and thought experiments, you'll discover how scientists' understanding of matter has evolved over time and how the arrangement and behavior of particles determine the properties we observe in everyday materials.
\end{quote}

\noindent This chapter aligns with the following NSW Syllabus outcomes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item SC4-16CW: Describes the observed properties and behaviour of matter, using scientific models including the kinetic theory
    \item SC4-7WS: Processes and analyses data from a first-hand investigation and secondary sources to identify trends, patterns and relationships, and draw conclusions
\end{itemize}

\newthought{Before we begin}, let's check what you already know about matter:

\begin{stopandthink}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What do you think matter is made of?
    \item Name the three common states of matter and give an example of each.
    \item What happens to water when it boils? When it freezes?
    \item Why can you compress (squeeze) a gas but not a solid?
\end{enumerate}
\end{stopandthink}

\section{What is Matter?}

\newthought{Matter} is anything that has mass and takes up space (has volume).
\marginnote{The word "matter" comes from the Latin word "materia," meaning stuff or substance.}
All the objects you can see and touch—water, air, rocks, plants, animals, and even you—are made of matter.

\keyword{Matter} is defined as anything composed of particles (atoms and molecules) that occupy space and have mass. Matter exists in different states with distinct physical properties.

\historylink{The idea that matter is made of tiny, indivisible particles dates back to ancient Greece. Philosopher Democritus (c. 460–370 BCE) proposed that all matter consists of "atomos," meaning "uncuttable" or "indivisible."}

\subsection{States of Matter}

Matter exists in different states, primarily:

\begin{keyconcept}{Three Common States of Matter}
\begin{description}
    \item[Solids] Have definite shape and volume. Particles are tightly packed in a regular arrangement and vibrate in place.
    
    \item[Liquids] Have definite volume but take the shape of their container. Particles are close together but can move past each other.
    
    \item[Gases] Have neither definite shape nor volume and fill their container. Particles are far apart and move freely in all directions.
\end{description}
\end{keyconcept}

%     \caption{Particle arrangement in solids, liquids, and gases.}
% \end{marginfigure}

There are also less common states of matter such as plasma (a gas-like state where atoms have been ionized) and Bose-Einstein condensates (a state that occurs near absolute zero temperature).

\challenge{Research plasma, the fourth state of matter. Where does it occur naturally? How is it used in technology? How does its particle arrangement differ from the other states?}

\section{Particle Theory of Matter}

\newthought{The particle theory} is a scientific model that explains the properties and behavior of matter based on the idea that all matter is made up of tiny particles.

\subsection{Key Principles of Particle Theory}

\begin{keyconcept}{Particle Theory of Matter}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item All matter is made up of tiny particles (atoms and molecules).
    
    \item These particles are in constant motion. The higher the temperature, the faster they move.
    
    \item There are forces of attraction between particles that vary in strength.
    
    \item There are spaces between particles, with more space in gases than in liquids or solids.
    
    \item Each pure substance has unique particles that differ from those of other substances.
\end{enumerate}
\end{keyconcept}

\historylink{The modern particle theory developed gradually over centuries. John Dalton (1766-1844) proposed the first modern atomic theory in the early 1800s, suggesting that elements consist of tiny particles called atoms.}

\subsection{How Particle Theory Explains Properties of Matter}

The particle theory helps us understand many everyday observations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Solids have definite shape} because their particles are held tightly together in fixed positions by strong attractive forces.
    
    \item \textbf{Liquids flow and take the shape of their container} because their particles can slide past each other while still being held together by moderate forces.
    
    \item \textbf{Gases expand to fill their container} because their particles have minimal attractive forces and move freely in all directions.
    
    \item \textbf{Diffusion} (the spreading of particles from an area of high concentration to low concentration) occurs because particles are in constant random motion.
    
    \item \textbf{Compression} of gases is possible because there is significant empty space between gas particles that can be reduced.
\end{itemize}

\begin{investigation}{Observing Diffusion}
\textbf{Purpose:} To observe diffusion in liquids and gases and explain it using particle theory.

\textbf{Materials:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Clear containers of water
    \item Food coloring
    \item Perfume or air freshener
    \item Stopwatch
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Procedure (Part 1 - Diffusion in Liquids):}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Fill a clear container with still water and let it settle.
    \item Carefully place one drop of food coloring in the center of the water.
    \item Observe what happens to the food coloring over time without disturbing the container.
    \item Record your observations at 30-second intervals for 5 minutes.
    \item Repeat the experiment with warm water and cold water.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Procedure (Part 2 - Diffusion in Gases):}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item In a still room, spray a small amount of perfume or air freshener in one corner.
    \item Record how long it takes for the scent to reach different parts of the room.
    \item Try the experiment again with the windows open or a fan running.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Questions:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How does particle theory explain your observations of the food coloring in water?
    \item What effect did temperature have on the rate of diffusion? Why?
    \item How does particle theory explain how scent travels through the air?
    \item Why does air movement affect the rate of diffusion?
    \item Predict what would happen if you tried to observe diffusion in a solid. Explain your prediction.
\end{enumerate}
\end{investigation}

\mathlink{Diffusion rates can be predicted mathematically. The average distance traveled by a particle during diffusion is proportional to the square root of time. This relationship is derived from the random motion of particles.}

\section{Particles in Solids, Liquids, and Gases}

\newthought{Let's explore} how the arrangement and movement of particles explain the properties of each state of matter in more detail.

\subsection{Particles in Solids}

In \keyword{solids}, particles are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Arranged in a regular, orderly pattern (often crystalline structures)
    \item Held together by strong attractive forces
    \item Vibrating in fixed positions
    \item Closely packed with minimal space between them
\end{itemize}

These particle characteristics explain why solids:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Maintain their shape and volume
    \item Cannot be compressed easily
    \item Generally have higher density than the same substance in liquid or gas form
    \item Expand slightly when heated (as particles vibrate more energetically)
\end{itemize}

% \begin{marginfigure}
%     \centering
%     \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{crystalline_structure.png}
%     \caption{The crystalline structure of sodium chloride (table salt), showing the regular arrangement of particles in a solid.}
% \end{marginfigure}

\subsection{Particles in Liquids}

In \keyword{liquids}, particles are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Close together but not in a regular pattern
    \item Able to move past each other
    \item Held together by moderate attractive forces
    \item Constantly moving with more energy than in solids
\end{itemize}

These particle characteristics explain why liquids:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Keep their volume but take the shape of their container
    \item Flow and can be poured
    \item Are difficult to compress
    \item Form a surface with surface tension
    \item Exhibit properties like viscosity (resistance to flow)
\end{itemize}

\historylink{The first detailed observation of Brownian motion—the random movement of particles in a fluid—was made by botanist Robert Brown in 1827. This was later explained by Albert Einstein in 1905, providing evidence for the existence of atoms.}

\subsection{Particles in Gases}

In \keyword{gases}, particles are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Far apart from each other
    \item Moving rapidly in all directions
    \item Experiencing minimal attractive forces between them
    \item Colliding with each other and with the container walls
\end{itemize}

These particle characteristics explain why gases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Have no fixed shape or volume
    \item Expand to fill their container
    \item Can be compressed easily
    \item Have much lower density than solids or liquids
    \item Exert pressure on container walls (due to particle collisions)
\end{itemize}

\begin{investigation}{Comparing Properties of States of Matter}
\textbf{Purpose:} To compare the properties of solids, liquids, and gases and relate them to particle theory.

\textbf{Materials:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Small wooden block or stone
    \item Water
    \item Balloons
    \item Syringes (without needles)
    \item Containers of different shapes
    \item Balance or scale
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Procedure:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Testing for Fixed Shape:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Place the solid object in different containers and observe its shape.
        \item Pour water between containers of different shapes and observe.
        \item Inflate a balloon, tie it, and change its shape by squeezing.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Testing for Fixed Volume:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Measure the dimensions of the solid and calculate its volume.
        \item Measure a volume of water and transfer it to different containers.
        \item Inflate a balloon and then squeeze it into a smaller container.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Testing for Compressibility:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Try to compress the solid by squeezing it.
        \item Fill a syringe with water, block the end, and try to push the plunger.
        \item Fill a syringe with air, block the end, and try to push the plunger.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Testing for Ability to Flow:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Tilt the solid on a surface and observe.
        \item Pour water from one container to another.
        \item Release air from an inflated balloon.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Analysis:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Create a table summarizing your observations for each state of matter.
    \item Explain each observation in terms of particle arrangement and movement.
    \item Draw diagrams showing the particle arrangement in each state.
    \item Based on your observations, which state is most affected by external pressure? Explain why.
\end{enumerate}
\end{investigation}

\section{Changes of State}

\newthought{Matter can change} from one state to another when energy is added or removed, typically in the form of heat.

\subsection{Types of State Changes}

\begin{keyconcept}{Changes of State}
\begin{description}
    \item[Melting] Solid → Liquid (energy absorbed)
    \item[Freezing] Liquid → Solid (energy released)
    \item[Vaporization] Liquid → Gas (energy absorbed)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Evaporation: occurs at the surface at any temperature
        \item Boiling: occurs throughout the liquid at a specific temperature
    \end{itemize}
    \item[Condensation] Gas → Liquid (energy released)
    \item[Sublimation] Solid → Gas (energy absorbed)
    \item[Deposition] Gas → Solid (energy released)
\end{description}
\end{keyconcept}

% \begin{marginfigure}
%     \centering
%     \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{state_changes.png}
%     \caption{Diagram showing different changes of state and whether energy is absorbed or released.}
% \end{marginfigure}

\mathlink{During a change of state, temperature remains constant even though energy is being added or removed. This energy is used to change the arrangement of particles rather than increase their speed. This is why the temperature of boiling water stays at 100°C until all the water has vaporized.}

\subsection{Explaining Changes of State Using Particle Theory}

Particle theory helps us understand what happens during changes of state:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Melting:} When a solid is heated, particles gain energy and vibrate more vigorously. Eventually, they gain enough energy to overcome some of the attractive forces, allowing them to move past each other while remaining close together.
    
    \item \textbf{Vaporization:} When a liquid is heated, particles gain more energy and move faster. Eventually, some particles gain enough energy to overcome the attractive forces and escape as gas particles.
    
    \item \textbf{Condensation:} When a gas is cooled, particles lose energy and slow down. As they slow, the attractive forces between particles become significant enough to pull them closer together, forming a liquid.
    
    \item \textbf{Freezing:} When a liquid is cooled, particles lose energy and slow down. Eventually, they have so little energy that the attractive forces arrange them into fixed positions in a regular pattern.
\end{itemize}

\begin{investigation}{Investigating Changes of State}
\textbf{Purpose:} To observe changes of state and relate them to particle theory.

\textbf{Materials:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ice
    \item Hot plate or heat source
    \item Thermometer
    \item Timer
    \item Beaker or heat-resistant container
    \item Graph paper
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Procedure:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Place ice in the beaker and insert the thermometer.
    \item Record the initial temperature.
    \item Place the beaker on the heat source (low setting).
    \item Record the temperature every 30 seconds.
    \item Continue recording until several minutes after the water has started boiling.
    \item Create a graph of temperature versus time.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Analysis:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify the parts of the graph where different changes of state occur.
    \item What happens to the temperature during each change of state? Why?
    \item Explain each change of state in terms of particle movement and energy.
    \item Why does the temperature increase at some points but not others?
    \item Predict and sketch how the graph would look if you started with boiling water and cooled it down to ice.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Extension:} Investigate how adding salt to ice affects the freezing/melting point and explain why this happens using particle theory.
\end{investigation}

\challenge{Dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) sublimates directly from solid to gas at atmospheric pressure. Research the conditions under which substances sublime rather than melt. Explain why some substances are more likely to sublime than others, and describe some practical applications of sublimation.}

\section{Gas Pressure and Temperature}

\newthought{The behavior of gases} can be well explained by particle theory, especially the relationships between pressure, volume, and temperature.

\subsection{Gas Pressure}

\keyword{Gas pressure} results from the constant collisions of gas particles with the walls of their container. The more frequent and forceful these collisions, the higher the pressure.

Factors that increase gas pressure include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Increasing the number of particles (more particles = more collisions)
    \item Decreasing the volume (particles collide with walls more frequently)
    \item Increasing the temperature (particles move faster and collide more forcefully)
\end{itemize}

% \begin{marginfigure}
%     \centering
%     \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{gas_pressure.png}
%     \caption{Gas particles colliding with container walls create pressure. More particles or faster-moving particles create higher pressure.}
% \end{marginfigure}

\subsection{The Effect of Temperature on Gases}

When a gas is heated:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Particles gain energy and move faster
    \item Particles collide more frequently and with greater force
    \item If the volume is fixed, pressure increases
    \item If the pressure is fixed, volume increases
\end{itemize}

\historylink{The relationship between gas volume and temperature was first described by Jacques Charles in the 1780s, who observed that gases expand when heated and contract when cooled.}

\begin{investigation}{Exploring Gas Pressure and Temperature}
\textbf{Purpose:} To investigate how temperature affects gas pressure and volume.

\textbf{Materials:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Empty plastic bottles with caps
    \item Balloons
    \item Hot and cold water
    \item Large bowl or container
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Procedure (Part 1 - Temperature and Volume):}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Stretch a balloon over the mouth of an empty plastic bottle.
    \item Place the bottle in a bowl of hot water.
    \item Observe what happens to the balloon.
    \item Transfer the bottle to a bowl of cold water.
    \item Observe any changes to the balloon.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Procedure (Part 2 - Temperature and Pressure):}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Take a plastic bottle and cap it tightly.
    \item Place the bottle in hot water for several minutes.
    \item Carefully observe any changes to the bottle.
    \item Transfer the bottle to cold water.
    \item Observe what happens to the bottle.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Questions:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What happened to the balloon when the bottle was placed in hot water? Explain in terms of particle theory.
    \item What happened to the balloon when the bottle was moved to cold water? Why?
    \item What happened to the plastic bottle when it was cooled after being heated? Explain.
    \item How do these observations relate to everyday situations, such as car tires in different weather conditions?
    \item Predict what would happen if you heated a sealed metal container of gas. Why might this be dangerous?
\end{enumerate}
\end{investigation}

\mathlink{The relationship between gas volume and temperature can be expressed mathematically as $V \propto T$, where V is volume and T is absolute temperature in Kelvin. This is Charles's Law. Similarly, the relationship between pressure and temperature at constant volume is $P \propto T$, which is Gay-Lussac's Law.}

\section{Evolution of Particle Theory}

\newthought{Our understanding} of the particle nature of matter has evolved over centuries through scientific observations, experiments, and the development of new technologies.

\subsection{Historical Development of Particle Theory}

The development of particle theory illustrates how scientific models change as new evidence emerges:

\begin{keyconcept}{Evolution of Particle Theory}
\begin{description}
    \item[Ancient Greek Atomism (5th century BCE)] Democritus proposed that all matter consists of indivisible particles called "atomos," separated by empty space.
    
    \item[Continuous Matter Theory (Aristotle, 4th century BCE)] Aristotle rejected atomism and argued that matter was continuous, made of four elements (earth, water, air, fire).
    
    \item[Revival of Atomism (17th-18th centuries)] Scientists like Robert Boyle, Isaac Newton, and Daniel Bernoulli began to explain gas behavior using particle models.
    
    \item[Dalton's Atomic Theory (early 1800s)] John Dalton proposed that elements consist of indivisible atoms with characteristic masses, and compounds form when atoms combine in specific ratios.
    
    \item[Kinetic Theory of Gases (mid-1800s)] Scientists like Rudolf Clausius and James Clerk Maxwell developed mathematical models of gases based on moving particles.
    
    \item[Evidence for Atoms (late 1800s-early 1900s)] Observations of Brownian motion and experiments by scientists like Jean Perrin provided direct evidence for the existence of atoms.
    
    \item[Modern Atomic Theory (20th century)] The discovery of subatomic particles (electrons, protons, neutrons) revealed that atoms are not indivisible but have internal structure.
\end{description}
\end{keyconcept}

\historylink{Many scientists initially rejected atomic theory. As late as 1900, prominent physicist Ernst Mach did not believe in the physical reality of atoms. It wasn't until Einstein's 1905 explanation of Brownian motion that skepticism largely disappeared.}

\subsection{The Dynamic Nature of Scientific Models}

The evolution of particle theory demonstrates key aspects of how science works:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Scientific models are based on available evidence and can change when new evidence emerges.
    
    \item Competing theories may exist simultaneously until evidence supports one over others.
    
    \item Technological advances (like improved microscopes) often enable new observations that lead to revised theories.
    
    \item Scientific knowledge builds over time, with each generation refining the understanding of previous generations.
\end{itemize}

\begin{investigation}{Modeling the Evolution of Scientific Thinking}
\textbf{Purpose:} To understand how scientific models evolve as new evidence becomes available.

\textbf{Activity:} In this role-playing activity, you will experience how scientific understanding changes over time.

\textbf{Procedure:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Divide into groups. Each group will represent scientists from a different historical period.
    
    \item Each group receives a sealed box containing an unknown object (prepared by the teacher). The box cannot be opened, only observed indirectly.
    
    \item Group 1 (Ancient Scientists):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item You can only weigh the box and shake it to hear sounds.
        \item Based on this limited evidence, develop a model of what might be inside.
        \item Present your model and reasoning to the class.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Group 2 (18th-Century Scientists):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item You can do everything Group 1 did, plus use magnets to test for magnetic properties and tilt the box to feel how the contents move.
        \item Develop a revised model based on this additional evidence.
        \item Present your model, explaining how the new evidence changed your understanding.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Group 3 (Modern Scientists):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item You can do everything previous groups did, plus use probes inserted through small holes, take measurements with instruments, and use imaging technology (simulated by the teacher providing additional clues).
        \item Develop a refined model based on all available evidence.
        \item Present your final model.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Finally, open the box to reveal the actual contents and compare with the models.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Discussion:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How did the models change as more evidence became available?
    \item Were early models completely wrong, or did they capture some aspects correctly?
    \item How does this activity mirror the historical development of particle theory?
    \item What does this tell us about the nature of scientific knowledge and how it develops?
    \item How might our current understanding of matter change in the future?
\end{enumerate}
\end{investigation}

\challenge{Research how one of these significant discoveries changed our understanding of matter: J.J. Thomson's discovery of the electron, Ernest Rutherford's gold foil experiment, or the development of the scanning tunneling microscope. Explain what the scientists observed, how it challenged existing models, and how it contributed to our current understanding of matter.}

\section{Applications of Particle Theory}

\newthought{Understanding the particle} nature of matter has numerous practical applications in everyday life and technology.

\subsection{Everyday Applications}

Particle theory helps explain many common phenomena:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cooking:} Heat transfer in cooking involves particle movement. Boiling, evaporation, and the hardening of proteins in cooking eggs all involve changes in particle arrangement and energy.
    
    \item \textbf{Storage and Packaging:} Food is stored differently based on its state. Gases require sealed, strong containers due to their particle behavior.
    
    \item \textbf{Weather:} The water cycle involves changes of state explained by particle theory. Evaporation, cloud formation (condensation), and precipitation all involve changes in water particle arrangement.
    
    \item \textbf{Refrigeration:} Refrigerators work by manipulating gas pressure and temperature relationships to transfer heat.
    
    \item \textbf{Thermometers:} Many thermometers work based on the expansion of liquids or gases as their particles gain energy and move more vigorously.

    \item Research the properties and behavior of plasma, often called the fourth state of matter. How does the particle arrangement in plasma differ from gases, and what conditions are required to create plasma?
    \item Analyze how the development of advanced microscopes (like scanning tunneling microscopes) has influenced our understanding of the particle nature of matter.
    \item Some substances, like glass, have properties of both solids and liquids. Research amorphous solids and explain their unusual properties in terms of particle arrangement.
    \item Design an experiment to investigate how the rate of diffusion is affected by temperature. Include your hypothesis, variables, procedure, and expected results.

\section{Glossary of Key Terms}

\begin{description}
    \item[Boiling] The change of state from liquid to gas that occurs throughout a liquid at a specific temperature.
    \item[Condensation] The change of state from gas to liquid.
    \item[Deposition] The change of state from gas directly to solid.
    \item[Diffusion] The process by which particles move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.
    \item[Evaporation] The change of state from liquid to gas that occurs at the surface of a liquid at any temperature.
    \item[Freezing] The change of state from liquid to solid.
    \item[Gas] A state of matter with no fixed shape or volume, where particles are far apart and move freely.
    \item[Liquid] A state of matter with a fixed volume but no fixed shape, where particles are close together but can move past each other.
    \item[Matter] Anything that has mass and takes up space.
    \item[Melting] The change of state from solid to liquid.
    \item[Particle theory] A scientific model that explains the properties and behavior of matter based on the idea that all matter is made up of tiny particles.
    \item[Pressure] Force per unit area, created in gases by particle collisions with container walls.
    \item[Solid] A state of matter with fixed shape and volume, where particles are arranged in a regular pattern and vibrate in place.
    \item[Sublimation] The change of state from solid directly to gas.
    \item[Temperature] A measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in matter.
