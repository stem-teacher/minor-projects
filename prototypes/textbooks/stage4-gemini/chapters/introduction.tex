Don't just passively read. Engage actively with the material to improve understanding and retention.
\end{marginnote}
Reading a science textbook isn't like reading a novel.  It requires active engagement.  Here are some active reading strategies:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Read with a Purpose:} Before you start reading a section, look at the headings, subheadings, and any learning objectives.  This will give you a sense of what to expect and what you should be focusing on.
    \item \textbf{Highlight and Underline Key Information:} As you read, highlight or underline key terms, definitions, and important concepts.  Be selective – don’t highlight everything! Focus on the most crucial information.
    \item \textbf{Take Notes in Your Own Words:}  Don’t just copy out sentences from the textbook.  Try to summarise the information in your own words.  This forces you to process and understand the material.  Use different note-taking methods like mind maps, bullet points, or Cornell notes to find what suits you best.
    \item \textbf{Ask Questions as You Read:}  If something is unclear, or if you're curious about something related to the text, write down your questions in the margin or in your notes.  Then, make an effort to find the answers – either by rereading the text, asking your teacher, or doing some further research.
    \item \textbf{Pause and Reflect:}  Don’t rush through the text.  Pause periodically to reflect on what you’ve just read.  Ask yourself questions like: \textit{“What are the main points of this section?”}, \textit{“Do I understand this concept?”}, \textit{“How does this relate to what I already know?”}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Regular Review and Practice}

\begin{marginnote}
\textbf{Spaced Repetition}

Reviewing material regularly, especially at spaced intervals, strengthens memory and understanding.
\end{marginnote}
Science builds upon itself.  Concepts you learn in one chapter will often be needed in later chapters.  Regular review is crucial to ensure that you retain what you’ve learned and can build upon it.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Review After Each Lesson:**  After each science lesson, take some time to review the material covered in class and in the textbook.  Reread your notes, look over highlighted sections, and try to summarise the key points from memory.
    \item \textbf{Use Chapter Summaries and Review Questions:**  As mentioned earlier, the chapter summaries and review questions are excellent tools for revision.  Work through them after you’ve finished reading a chapter to check your understanding.
    \item \textbf{Spaced Repetition:**  Don't just cram everything in right before a test.  Review material at spaced intervals – for example, review a topic a day after you learn it, then again a few days later, then again a week later, and so on.  Spaced repetition is a highly effective way to strengthen long-term memory.
    \item \textbf{Practice Problems and Examples:**  In chapters that involve calculations or problem-solving, make sure to work through all the worked examples and try additional practice problems if available.  Practice is essential to develop your problem-solving skills.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Don't Be Afraid to Ask Questions}

\begin{marginnote}
\textbf{Curiosity is Key}

Asking questions is a sign of active learning and a crucial step towards deeper understanding.
\end{marginnote}
Science is all about asking questions!  If you don’t understand something, or if you’re curious about something, don’t hesitate to ask questions.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ask Your Teacher:** Your teacher is your primary resource.  If you’re confused about a concept, or if you have questions about an investigation, ask your teacher for clarification.  They are there to help you learn.
    \item \textbf{Ask Classmates:**  Discussing science with your classmates can be very helpful.  You can learn from each other’s perspectives and help each other understand difficult concepts.  Form study groups and work together on problems and investigations.
    \item \textbf{Use Online Resources (Wisely):**  The internet is a vast resource for learning science.  There are many excellent websites, videos, and interactive simulations that can help you understand concepts.  However, be sure to use reliable sources and be critical of the information you find online. Always cross-reference information from multiple sources.
\end{itemize}
