# Best Practices in Science Textbook Design for Gifted Students

Science textbooks for years 7-10 should integrate interactive e-texts, visual supports, and accessibility features like text-to-speech and hyperlinked vocabulary to support PISA 2025 alignment and enhance learning for diverse students.

## Abstract

Interactive e-texts and visual supports enhance science learning for secondary students, particularly those with autism. Ediyanto et al. (2020) report that interactive books and computer programs foster science learning among students with ASD. Hart Barnett et al. (2018) note that visual supports promote engagement in science discussions. Supported eTexts—incorporating increased font size, text-to-speech, and hyperlinked vocabulary—yield improved comprehension and higher correct response rates, as demonstrated by Knight et al. (2015). Mathew (2023) documents that cooperative learning paired with an 8-way intelligence framework is associated with an expected 50% increase in student participation in science classes.

No study addressed design strategies tailored specifically for gifted students with ADHD/autism. Hence, current evidence supports textbook designs that integrate technology-enhanced, visually supportive, and differentiated instructional approaches to align with the PISA 2025 Science Framework for students in school years 7–10.

## Paper Search

Using your research question "What would be best practice in text book design for teaching science for school years 7-10 (ages 12-16) that best supports growth in the PISA 2025 Science Framework, particularly for gifted students with ADHD / autism.", we searched across over 126 million academic papers from the Semantic Scholar corpus. We retrieved the 500 papers most relevant to the query.

## Screening

We screened in papers that met these criteria:

- **Population Age Range**: Does the study include students aged 12-16 years (grades 7-10)?
- **Population Characteristics**: Does the study specifically examine students who are both gifted AND have ADHD and/or autism?
- **Subject Area**: Does the study focus primarily on science education?
- **Learning Materials**: Does the study examine textbook design, layout, content organization, or specialized learning materials?
- **Design Components**: Does the study include specific material design components rather than only general teaching methods?
- **Outcomes**: Does the study measure outcomes that align with one or more PISA Science Framework components (scientific competencies, knowledge, or attitudes)?
- **Study Type**: Is the study either primary research with multiple participants OR a systematic review/meta-analysis?

We considered all screening questions together and made a holistic judgement about whether to screen in each paper.

## Data Extraction

We asked a large language model to extract each data column below from each paper. We gave the model the extraction instructions shown below for each column.

### Study Design Type:
Identify the specific type of research design used in the study. Look in the methods section for explicit description of the study design. Possible types include:
- Experimental study
- Quasi-experimental study
- Observational study
- Case study
- Literature review
- Pilot study

If the design is not clearly stated, review the methodology section to determine the most appropriate classification. If multiple design elements are present, list all that apply.

### Target Population Characteristics:
Extract detailed information about study participants, focusing specifically on:
- Age range (ensure it matches 12-16 years)
- Presence of ADHD or autism spectrum disorder
- Educational setting (school type, grade level)
- Specific learning characteristics or needs

Look in participant description sections, typically found in methods or participant sections. If multiple subgroups are described, extract information for each. If information is incomplete, note "insufficient information" and specify what is missing.

### Textbook/Learning Material Characteristics:
Identify and describe specific features of science learning materials used:
- Type of material (e-text, printed textbook, digital resource)
- Specific design modifications for students with ADHD/autism
- Alignment with PISA 2025 Science Framework elements
- Support mechanisms integrated into the material

Search methods, results, and discussion sections. If multiple materials are used, describe each. If design features are not explicitly detailed, note "design features not specified".

### Learning Support Strategies:
Extract specific strategies used to support science learning:
- Cognitive support mechanisms
- Language adaptation techniques
- Comprehension enhancement methods
- Engagement strategies for neurodivergent learners

Examine intervention description, methods, and results sections. Prioritize strategies specifically targeting ADHD or autism spectrum students. If no specific strategies are mentioned, write "No specialized support strategies described".

### Science Learning Outcomes:
Identify and extract:
- Specific science learning outcomes measured
- Quantitative results (if available)
- Performance metrics related to PISA 2025 Science Framework competencies
- Specific outcomes for students with ADHD/autism

Review results and discussion sections. If statistical data is present, record exact figures. If outcomes are qualitative, summarize key findings. If no clear outcomes are reported, note "Outcomes not specified".
