\chapter{Scientific Investigations and Research Skills}

\section*{Chapter Overview}

\begin{quote}
    In this chapter, we'll build on your scientific inquiry skills from Stage 4 and develop more sophisticated approaches to investigations. You'll learn advanced experimental design techniques, how to analyze the reliability and validity of data, and how to conduct independent research projects. These skills will prepare you for the mandatory student research project (SRP) and develop your abilities as an independent scientific investigator.
\end{quote}

\noindent This chapter aligns with the following NSW Syllabus outcomes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item SC5-4WS: Develops questions or hypotheses to be investigated scientifically
    \item SC5-5WS: Produces a plan to investigate identified questions, hypotheses or problems, individually and collaboratively
    \item SC5-6WS: Undertakes first-hand investigations to collect valid and reliable data and information, individually and collaboratively
    \item SC5-7WS: Processes, analyzes and evaluates data from first-hand investigations and secondary sources to develop evidence-based arguments and conclusions
    \item SC5-8WS: Applies scientific understanding and critical thinking skills to suggest possible solutions to identified problems
    \item SC5-9WS: Presents science ideas and evidence for a particular purpose and to a specific audience, using appropriate scientific language, conventions and representations
\end{itemize}

\newthought{Before we begin}, let's assess your current understanding of scientific investigations:

\begin{stopandthink}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What makes a scientific question or hypothesis testable?
    \item How do you know if scientific data is reliable?
    \item What's the difference between a variable and a control in an experiment?
    \item What kinds of information should be included in a scientific report?
\end{enumerate}
\end{stopandthink}

\section{Advanced Experimental Design}

\newthought{Designing rigorous} experiments is essential for generating valid scientific knowledge. At Stage 5, we'll refine our experimental design skills to account for more factors.

\subsection{Variables and Controls Revisited}

Recall from Stage 4 that well-designed experiments carefully manage variables:

\begin{keyconcept}{Key Variables in Experiments}
\begin{description}
    \item[Independent variable] The factor deliberately changed by the experimenter
    \item[Dependent variable] The factor measured to determine the effect of the independent variable
    \item[Controlled variables] Factors kept constant to ensure a fair test
\end{description}
\end{keyconcept}

At Stage 5, we need to consider additional aspects of variables:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Continuous vs. Categorical Variables:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Continuous variables can take any numerical value (e.g., temperature, time, mass)
        \item Categorical variables fall into distinct categories (e.g., types of soil, species of plant)
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Range and Intervals:} For continuous independent variables, you need to determine an appropriate range and intervals to test (e.g., testing temperature at 10°C, 20°C, 30°C, and 40°C)
    
    \item \textbf{Confounding Variables:} Factors that might influence results but aren't part of your experimental design
\end{itemize}

\mathlink{When determining sample size, consider statistical power. Larger sample sizes generally provide more reliable results. A common guideline is to have at least 30 data points for statistical significance, though this varies by field and experiment type.}

\subsection{Experimental Controls}

Controls are crucial for valid scientific investigations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Negative Controls:} Samples that aren't exposed to the experimental treatment and should show no effect
    
    \item \textbf{Positive Controls:} Samples that are exposed to a treatment known to cause an effect, confirming the experiment can detect the effect
    
    \item \textbf{Procedural Controls:} Tests that check whether experimental procedures themselves affect results
\end{itemize}

    \centering
    % \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{experimental_design.png}
    % \caption{Example of an experimental design showing treatment group, control group, and key variables.}
% \end{marginfigure}

\historylink{The concept of a "controlled experiment" with proper controls was established by Claude Bernard (1813-1878), a French physiologist who emphasized the need for comparison groups in scientific experiments.}

\subsection{Sampling Techniques}

How you select samples can significantly impact your results:

\begin{keyconcept}{Sampling Methods}
\begin{description}
    \item[Random sampling] Every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected
    \item[Stratified sampling] The population is divided into subgroups, and samples are taken from each
    \item[Systematic sampling] Selecting every nth member from the population
    \item[Convenience sampling] Using easily accessible samples (generally less reliable)
\end{description}
\end{keyconcept}

\challenge{Research the concept of "pseudoreplication" in scientific experiments. Why is it a problem, and how can scientists avoid it? Find an example of a study where pseudoreplication might have affected the results.}

\begin{investigation}{Designing a Rigorous Experiment}
\textbf{Purpose:} To practice designing an experiment with appropriate variables, controls, and sampling techniques.

\textbf{Scenario:} Your team wants to investigate the effect of different fertilizers on plant growth.

\textbf{Task:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Formulate a specific, testable hypothesis about fertilizers and plant growth.
    
    \item Design an experiment that includes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Clearly identified independent and dependent variables
        \item At least five controlled variables with explanations of how you'll control each
        \item Appropriate control groups (negative and/or positive)
        \item Sample size justification and sampling method
        \item Measurement techniques with attention to precision and accuracy
        \item Timeline for the experiment
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Create a detailed procedural outline that another team could follow.
    
    \item Identify potential confounding variables and how you'll address them.
    
    \item Design a data collection table and explain how you'll analyze the results.
    
    \item Discuss potential limitations of your experimental design.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Extension:} Develop a mini research proposal that includes a literature review section discussing previous related studies and how your experiment builds on existing knowledge.
\end{investigation}

\section{Data Reliability and Validity}

\newthought{Not all data} is created equal. Scientists must assess data quality to draw sound conclusions.

\subsection{Reliability vs. Validity}

\begin{keyconcept}{Reliability and Validity}
\begin{description}
    \item[Reliability] The consistency or repeatability of measurements
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Test-retest reliability: Same results when repeated
        \item Inter-rater reliability: Different observers get same results
        \item Internal consistency: Different methods give similar results
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item[Validity] The accuracy of measurements in representing what they claim to measure
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Construct validity: Measures what it claims to measure
        \item Internal validity: Supports cause-and-effect relationships
        \item External validity: Results can be generalized beyond the study
    \end{itemize}
\end{description}
\end{keyconcept}

\subsection{Sources of Error and Uncertainty}

Understanding sources of error helps evaluate data quality:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Random errors:} Unpredictable variations in measurements (can be reduced by taking multiple measurements)
    
    \item \textbf{Systematic errors:} Consistent, predictable deviations (e.g., miscalibrated instrument)
    
    \item \textbf{Human errors:} Mistakes in conducting procedures or recording data
    
    \item \textbf{Environmental factors:} Uncontrolled conditions affecting results
\end{itemize}

\mathlink{Uncertainty in measurements can be expressed mathematically. For a set of repeated measurements, calculate the standard deviation ($\sigma$) using the formula: $\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum(x-\mu)^2}{N}}$ where $x$ is each value, $\mu$ is the mean, and $N$ is the number of values. A smaller standard deviation indicates more precise measurements.}

\subsection{Improving Data Quality}

Strategies to enhance reliability and validity include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Replication:} Repeating experiments multiple times
    
    \item \textbf{Standardization:} Using consistent methods and conditions
    
    \item \textbf{Calibration:} Ensuring instruments give accurate readings
    
    \item \textbf{Blinding:} Preventing bias by hiding treatment information
    
    \item \textbf{Appropriate sample sizes:} Collecting sufficient data for statistical analysis
    
    \item \textbf{Triangulation:} Using multiple methods to measure the same variable
\end{itemize}

\begin{investigation}{Evaluating Data Reliability and Validity}
\textbf{Purpose:} To analyze sources of error and assess data quality.

\textbf{Materials:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Different measuring instruments (e.g., rulers, measuring cylinders, electronic balances, thermometers)
    \item Objects or substances to measure
    \item Data recording sheets
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Procedure (Part 1 - Instrument Precision):}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Select an object or substance to measure (e.g., volume of water, mass of a weight, length of an object).
    \item Using the same instrument, take 10 repeat measurements of the same property.
    \item Calculate the mean, range, and standard deviation of your measurements.
    \item Repeat with different types or brands of instruments measuring the same property.
    \item Compare the precision of different instruments.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Procedure (Part 2 - Observer Reliability):}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Have multiple class members measure the same property using the same instrument.
    \item Compare the measurements and calculate inter-observer reliability.
    \item Discuss factors that might cause different observers to get different results.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Analysis:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Which instruments showed the highest precision (lowest variation in repeated measurements)?
    \item What factors contributed to measurement errors in your experiment?
    \item How could you improve the reliability of these measurements?
    \item Discuss how the concept of significant figures relates to instrument precision.
    \item How would measurement errors affect conclusions in scientific research?
\end{enumerate}
\end{investigation}

\section{Research Methodologies}

\newthought{Scientific research} extends beyond controlled experiments. Different research questions require different methodologies.

\subsection{Types of Scientific Investigations}

\begin{keyconcept}{Research Methodologies}
\begin{description}
    \item[Controlled experiments] Manipulating variables under controlled conditions to test cause-and-effect relationships
    
    \item[Field studies] Collecting data in natural settings where variables cannot be fully controlled
    
    \item[Observational studies] Recording observations without intervention or manipulation
    
    \item[Case studies] In-depth investigations of single instances or events
    
    \item[Surveys and questionnaires] Collecting self-reported data from participants
    
    \item[Meta-analyses] Systematically combining results from multiple studies
    
    \item[Modeling] Using mathematical or computational models to simulate processes
\end{description}
\end{keyconcept}

Each methodology has strengths and limitations. The choice depends on your research question, available resources, ethical considerations, and practical constraints.

\historylink{The scientific method as we understand it today evolved gradually. Different disciplines developed specialized methodologies—for example, geology relies heavily on observational studies due to the timescales involved, while chemistry often emphasizes controlled laboratory experiments.}

\subsection{Choosing the Right Methodology}

Consider these factors when selecting a research approach:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Research question type:} "How" and "why" questions often need experiments; "what" and "how many" might use surveys
    
    \item \textbf{Control of variables:} Can you manipulate variables, or must you observe them naturally?
    
    \item \textbf{Timescale:} Some phenomena occur over periods too long for direct experimentation
    
    \item \textbf{Ethical considerations:} Some experiments might not be ethical to conduct
    
    \item \textbf{Resources and practicality:} Consider equipment, time, and expertise needed
    
    \item \textbf{Sample accessibility:} Can you access appropriate samples?
\end{itemize}

% \begin{marginfigure}
    \centering
    % \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{research_methods.png}
    % \caption{Decision tree for selecting an appropriate research methodology based on your research question and constraints.}
% \end{marginfigure}

\subsection{Mixed Methods Approaches}

Many modern scientists use mixed methods, combining multiple approaches to gain comprehensive understanding:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Quantitative methods provide numerical data and statistical analyses
    \item Qualitative methods provide descriptive, contextual information
    \item Using both can provide complementary insights
\end{itemize}

\challenge{Choose a recent scientific discovery in any field. Research the methodology used by the scientists. What made this method appropriate for their research question? Could they have used alternative approaches? What would be the advantages or disadvantages of those alternatives?}

\begin{investigation}{Comparing Research Methodologies}
\textbf{Purpose:} To evaluate different research approaches for a scientific question.

\textbf{Task:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Select one of these research questions (or propose your own with teacher approval):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item How does sleep duration affect academic performance?
        \item What factors influence local bird species diversity?
        \item How effective are different face mask types at filtering particles?
        \item What is the relationship between exercise intensity and heart rate recovery time?
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item For your chosen question, design three different research approaches:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A controlled experiment
        \item An observational study
        \item A survey-based study
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item For each methodology, provide:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A detailed description of the method
        \item The types of data you would collect
        \item How you would analyze the data
        \item Potential sources of error or bias
        \item Strengths and limitations of the approach
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Recommend which methodology (or combination) would be most appropriate for the research question and justify your recommendation.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Extension:} Design a mixed-methods approach that combines quantitative and qualitative elements to address your research question more comprehensively.
\end{investigation}

\section{Statistical Analysis of Data}

\newthought{Analyzing data} statistically allows scientists to draw meaningful conclusions and determine whether results are significant.

\subsection{Descriptive Statistics}

Descriptive statistics summarize and organize data:

\begin{keyconcept}{Descriptive Statistical Measures}
\begin{description}
    \item[Measures of central tendency] 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Mean: The average of all values
        \item Median: The middle value when arranged in order
        \item Mode: The most frequently occurring value
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item[Measures of spread] 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Range: The difference between the highest and lowest values
        \item Standard deviation: A measure of how spread out the data is from the mean
        \item Interquartile range: The range of the middle 50\% of the data
    \end{itemize}
\end{description}
\end{keyconcept}

\mathlink{The formula for the mean (average) is $\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}$ where $x_i$ represents each value and $n$ is the number of values. For example, the mean of 4, 7, and 10 is $\frac{4+7+10}{3} = 7$.}

\subsection{Interpreting Data Graphically}

Visual representations help identify patterns and trends:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scatter plots:} Show relationships between two continuous variables
    \item \textbf{Line graphs:} Display trends over time or continuous data
    \item \textbf{Bar graphs:} Compare discrete categories
    \item \textbf{Box plots:} Show distribution, central tendency, and outliers
    \item \textbf{Histograms:} Display frequency distributions
\end{itemize}

% \begin{marginfigure}
    \centering
    % \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{data_visualization.png}
    % \caption{Different types of graphs used to represent scientific data. The choice depends on the data type and what patterns you want to highlight.}
% \end{marginfigure}

\subsection{Inferential Statistics}

Inferential statistics help determine whether results are statistically significant:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Statistical significance:} The likelihood that results are not due to random chance
    
    \item \textbf{P-value:} The probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as those observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true (typically, p < 0.05 is considered significant)
    
    \item \textbf{Confidence intervals:} The range within which the true value likely falls
    
    \item \textbf{Common tests:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item T-test: Compares means between two groups
        \item ANOVA: Compares means among three or more groups
        \item Chi-square test: Analyzes categorical data
        \item Correlation: Measures relationship strength between variables
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\historylink{The concept of statistical significance and p-values was developed by Ronald Fisher in the 1920s. His contributions revolutionized experimental design and data analysis in scientific research.}

\subsection{Correlation vs. Causation}

A critical concept in data analysis is understanding that correlation doesn't imply causation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Correlation:} Two variables change together (positive, negative, or no correlation)
    \item \textbf{Causation:} One variable directly causes changes in another
    \item \textbf{Alternative explanations:} Third variables, reverse causality, or coincidence
\end{itemize}

\begin{investigation}{Analyzing Scientific Data}
\textbf{Purpose:} To practice statistical analysis of experimental data.

\textbf{Scenario:} A scientist conducted an experiment to test the effect of light intensity on plant growth. Twenty identical plants were randomly assigned to four groups, each exposed to a different light intensity (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of full sunlight). After four weeks, plant height (cm) was measured. The results are shown below:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Plant} & \textbf{25\% Light} & \textbf{50\% Light} & \textbf{75\% Light} & \textbf{100\% Light} \\
\hline
1 & 10.2 & 15.6 & 18.7 & 17.8 \\
\hline
2 & 9.8 & 14.9 & 19.1 & 16.9 \\
\hline
3 & 11.3 & 16.2 & 20.5 & 18.2 \\
\hline
4 & 8.9 & 15.4 & 19.8 & 17.5 \\
\hline
5 & 10.5 & 15.8 & 18.2 & 17.1 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Tasks:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Calculate descriptive statistics for each light intensity group:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Mean plant height
        \item Median plant height
        \item Range of heights
        \item Standard deviation (if you have access to calculators or software)
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Create appropriate graphs to visualize the data:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A bar graph showing mean height for each light intensity
        \item A scatter plot of light intensity vs. plant height
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Analyze and interpret the results:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Is there a relationship between light intensity and plant height?
        \item What type of relationship is it (positive, negative, nonlinear)?
        \item At what light intensity did plants grow tallest?
        \item Can you conclude that light intensity causes the observed differences? Why or why not?
        \item What other factors might have influenced the results?
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Draw a conclusion about the optimal light intensity for these plants, supporting your answer with statistical evidence.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Extension:} Research and apply a t-test to determine if the differences between groups are statistically significant. Report your calculated p-value and interpret what it means.
\end{investigation}

\challenge{Find a news article that misinterprets correlation as causation. Analyze the article, identifying the variables involved and possible alternative explanations for the relationship. Rewrite a short paragraph of the article to more accurately represent the scientific limitations of the finding.}

\section{Conducting a Student Research Project}

\end{investigation}

\section{Scientific Communication and Peer Review}

\newthought{Communicating your findings} effectively is a crucial part of the scientific process. Science progresses through the sharing and evaluation of research.

\subsection{Scientific Writing}

Effective scientific writing is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Clear:} Uses precise, unambiguous language
    \item \textbf{Concise:} Avoids unnecessary words and jargon
    \item \textbf{Objective:} Presents facts and evidence without bias
    \item \textbf{Structured:} Follows conventional scientific format
    \item \textbf{Substantiated:} Supports claims with evidence and citations
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Visual Communication in Science}

    % \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{data_visualization_principles.png}
    % \caption{Principles of effective data visualization. Good visuals make complex data easier to understand and interpret.}
% \end{marginfigure}

\subsection{The Peer Review Process}

Peer review is fundamental to scientific progress:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Purpose:} Ensure quality, validity, and integrity of scientific publications
    \item \textbf{Process:} Experts in the field anonymously evaluate research
    \item \textbf{Criteria:} Methodology, data analysis, interpretation, significance, clarity
    \item \textbf{Outcomes:} Accept, revise, or reject for publication
    \item \textbf{Limitations:} Potential for bias, time-consuming, may miss some issues
\end{itemize}

\historylink{The modern peer review system began in the mid-20th century, but forms of scientific critique date back to the 17th century with the Royal Society's Philosophical Transactions, established in 1665 as the first scientific journal.}

\begin{investigation}{Scientific Communication and Peer Review}
\textbf{Purpose:} To practice scientific writing, visualization, and peer review.

\textbf{Part 1: Scientific Writing}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Select a simple scientific experiment that your class has conducted previously.
    \item Write a short scientific report (600-800 words) following the standard format:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Title

\section{Ethics in Scientific Research}

\newthought{Ethical considerations} should guide all aspects of scientific research. As science advances, new ethical questions emerge.

\subsection{Principles of Research Ethics}

Key ethical principles include:

\begin{keyconcept}{Core Ethical Principles in Research}
\begin{description}
    \item[Respect for persons] Treating participants with dignity; obtaining informed consent
    \item[Beneficence] Minimizing harm while maximizing benefits
    \item[Justice] Ensuring fair distribution of benefits and burdens
    \item[Integrity] Honesty in data collection, analysis, and reporting
    \item[Transparency] Open methods, data sharing, and disclosure of conflicts
    \item[Responsibility] Considering broader impacts of research
\end{description}
\end{keyconcept}

\subsection{Ethical Considerations in Different Fields}

Ethical issues vary across scientific disciplines:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Biological Sciences:} Animal welfare, conservation impacts, biosafety
    \item \textbf{Medical Research:} Human subject protection, privacy, equitable access
    \item \textbf{Environmental Sciences:} Ecosystem impacts, sustainable practices
    \item \textbf{Chemistry:} Chemical safety, waste management, dual-use concerns
    \item \textbf{Physics and Engineering:} Safety testing, energy considerations, security implications
    \item \textbf{Data Science:} Privacy, bias in algorithms, consent for data use
\end{itemize}

\historylink{The Nuremberg Code (1947) and the Declaration of Helsinki (1964) established fundamental principles for ethical human subjects research, in response to unethical experiments conducted during World War II.}

\subsection{Emerging Ethical Challenges}

Scientific advances create new ethical questions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Genetic technologies:} CRISPR, gene therapy, genetic privacy
    \item \textbf{Artificial intelligence:} Automation impact, algorithmic bias, autonomous systems
    \item \textbf{Climate engineering:} Geoengineering risks, intergenerational impacts
    \item \textbf{Synthetic biology:} Creating new organisms, biosecurity
    \item \textbf{Neurotechnology:} Brain-computer interfaces, cognitive enhancement
\end{itemize}

\begin{pisascenario}{Gene Editing and Society}
Scientists can now edit genes with a technique called CRISPR-Cas9, which allows precise modifications to DNA. This technology could potentially eliminate genetic diseases, but also raises concerns about unintended effects, equity of access, and the ethics of human enhancement.

\textbf{Scenario:} A research team plans to use CRISPR to edit genes in human embryos to remove a mutation that causes a fatal childhood disease. The edited embryos would be implanted and develop into babies free from the disease.

\textbf{Multiple Perspectives:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Medical researchers argue this could eliminate suffering and save lives.
    \item Ethicists worry about unintended effects and slippery slopes toward enhancement.
    \item Patient advocates support the treatment but worry about affordability and access.
    \item Some religious groups oppose any modification of human embryos.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Data:} A survey of 1,500 people showed varied opinions about gene editing:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Purpose} & \textbf{Support (\%)} & \textbf{Oppose (\%)} & \textbf{Unsure (\%)} \\
\hline
Treat fatal disease & 72 & 18 & 10 \\
\hline
Prevent non-fatal disease & 60 & 25 & 15 \\
\hline
Enhance traits (e.g., intelligence) & 15 & 75 & 10 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Questions:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify the key ethical considerations in this gene editing scenario.
    \item Based on the survey data, how does public opinion vary depending on the purpose of gene editing? What might explain these differences?
    \item If you were on an ethics review board evaluating this research proposal, what additional information would you need? What guidelines would you recommend?
    \item How can society balance scientific progress with ethical considerations in emerging technologies? Provide a reasoned argument supported by evidence.
\end{enumerate}
\end{pisascenario}

\begin{investigation}{Ethical Research Design}
\textbf{Purpose:} To identify ethical considerations in scientific research and develop strategies to address them.

\textbf{Task:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Select one research scenario from the list below:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Testing a new air pollution monitor by placing devices in different neighborhoods
        \item Studying the effects of social media use on adolescent mental health
        \item Investigating the impact of a new fertilizer on soil microorganisms
        \item Developing facial recognition software using publicly available images
        \item Testing the effectiveness of a newly developed insect repellent
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item For your chosen scenario, conduct an ethical analysis:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Identify all stakeholders who might be affected
        \item List potential benefits of the research
        \item Identify potential harms or risks
        \item Discuss issues of consent, privacy, and confidentiality
        \item Consider environmental impacts
        \item Examine questions of justice and fairness
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Develop an ethically sound research plan that addresses the concerns you identified:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item How will you obtain informed consent?
        \item What safeguards will you implement to minimize risks?
        \item How will you ensure privacy and data security?
        \item How will you address environmental considerations?
        \item How will you ensure fair treatment of all involved?
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Create an "Ethics Statement" for your research plan that could be included in a grant proposal or publication.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Extension:} Research a real-world example of scientific research that raised ethical concerns. Analyze how the researchers and regulatory bodies addressed these issues, and suggest how the situation could have been handled better.
