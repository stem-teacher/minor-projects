  1. Created a modular structure with:
    - main-textbook.tex: The main file that includes all the chapters
    - chapters/introduction.tex: Introduction to the textbook
    - chapters/chapter1.tex: Introduction to Scientific Inquiry
    - chapters/chapter2.tex: Properties of Matter (Particle Theory)
  2. Set up the images directory and copied the images (though they're currently empty placeholders)
  3. Temporarily commented out the image references to ensure the document compiles
  4. Successfully created a PDF from the new structure

  This modular approach has several advantages:
  - Makes it easier to edit individual chapters without affecting others
  - Improves collaboration as different people can work on different chapters
  - Simplifies the review process as reviewers can focus on specific chapters
  - Makes it easier to rearrange or add chapters in the future

  To complete this restructuring, you would need to:
  1. Add the remaining chapters (3-10) as separate files
  2. Replace the empty image files with actual content
  3. Uncomment the image references once the images are available

‚è∫ Perfect! We've successfully restructured the Stage 4 textbook. Here's a summary of what we did:
