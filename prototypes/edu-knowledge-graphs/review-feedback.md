Improvements for the Responses
	1.	Syllabus Traceability:
	•	Both responses should more explicitly reference the official NSW outcome codes (e.g., “PH11-8,” “PH12-12”), Working Scientifically codes (“PHWS2,” etc.), and the corresponding content descriptions. A direct link from each JSON node back to the syllabus document ensures every knowledge node is anchored to its official outcome.
	2.	Granularity and Bloom’s Alignment:
	•	Strengthen the detail on Bloom’s level for each sub-node. For example, a node covering Newton’s First Law (PHY_KIN_NL1) should clarify whether the focus is on Understanding or Applying it. This helps teachers generate suitable tasks and assessments.
	3.	Exam Question Integration:
	•	Ensure past HSC exam data (question IDs, sample responses) is fully linked to the correct knowledge nodes. Each node – law, skill, or concept – should contain references to relevant exam questions. This chunking helps students and teachers use the knowledge graph for targeted exam practice.
	4.	Working Scientifically Skills:
	•	Explicitly include the “workingScientificallyCategory” where relevant. Make sure each node either references “Questioning & Predicting,” “Analysing,” etc. (if applicable), or is marked “null” if that skill is not covered.
	5.	Metadata Completeness:
	•	Each node’s metadata (e.g., literacySkills, numeracySkills, prerequisiteNodes) should reflect real teaching sequences. This “vertical integration” guides teachers on the best conceptual path.
	•	For instance, a node referencing projectile motion might require prior knowledge on vectors.
	•	Link to “essential skills” such as “graphing,” “data interpretation,” or “variable identification.”
	6.	Consistency in JSON Schema:
	•	Use consistent naming for JSON keys (e.g., bloomTaxonomyLevel, workingScientificallyCategory).
	•	Each “media” array item should clarify type – “image:”, “video:”, etc.
	7.	Cross-Curriculum Connections and Depth Studies:
	•	Indicate cross-disciplinary icons (e.g., numeracy, literacy) using an array.
	•	For depth studies, make sure there is a dedicated node or set of nodes that reference practical experiments, hypothesis formulation, and advanced analysis tasks.
	8.	Pedagogical Clarity:
	•	Explanations in the “description” fields should be concise but complete, referencing real-world examples or required conceptual clarifications.
	•	Where possible, unify common misunderstandings (e.g., confusion about weight vs. mass) so teachers or AI systems can detect student misconceptions.

Key Tasks to Complete the Knowledge Graph
	1.	Full Outcome Mapping:
	•	Verify each node is tied to at least one Stage 6 outcome and the correct official numbering from the syllabus.
	•	Add any missing knowledge areas (especially from the “Working Scientifically” domain).
	2.	Exam Database Linkage:
	•	Systematically incorporate 7–10 years of Physics HSC questions. Make sure each question’s examQuestionId references the relevant knowledge nodes.
	•	Include marking criteria and exemplar answers in the question metadata so that the knowledge graph can surface guidance for teacher or student revision.
	3.	Depth Study Nodes:
	•	Create dedicated nodes for required depth studies. Link them to practical skills, relevant content nodes, and possible real-life applications.
	•	Indicate required practical investigations, data-collection methods, and suggested depth study topics.
	4.	Completeness Checks (Automated Testing):
	•	Implement a script (or in-tool validation) verifying all mandatory outcomes and skill codes appear at least once.
	•	Validate correct Bloom’s level usage and that each node has a one-to-one or one-to-many mapping to the relevant syllabus references.
	5.	Metadata Standardization:
	•	Ensure uniform naming conventions for node fields across Physics (and eventually Chemistry).
	•	Where appropriate, adopt controlled vocabularies for type, bloomTaxonomyLevel, workingScientificallyCategory, etc.
	6.	Progress & Analytics Integration (Future Phase):
	•	Set up “assessmentData” structures to track students’ attainment of each node.
	•	Link the “studentProgressTracking” to typical assessment tasks (formative, summative).
	7.	Iterative Review with Syllabus Updates:
	•	Confirm any new official syllabus updates are reflected (e.g., clarifications, small changes).
	•	Schedule an annual or biannual review to keep the knowledge graph current.
