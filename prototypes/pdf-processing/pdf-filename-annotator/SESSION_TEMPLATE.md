# Claude Code Session: [Date]

## Initial State Assessment

I've reviewed the current project state from CURRENT_STATE.md and determined:

- **Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Project Setup and Configuration
- **Current Task**: Task 1.2 - Fix type issues in processor.rs
- **Current Subtask**: Subtask 1.2.1 - Fix ObjectId type handling
- **Target File**: src/processor.rs
- **Current Status**: Compilation failing due to ObjectId type issues
- **Last Successful Compilation**: None (processor.rs has compilation errors)
- **Last Verified Test Run**: Partial (find_pdf_files test passes)

## Test-First Development Approach

For this session, I will follow the test-first development methodology:

1. First write/modify the test for proper ObjectId handling
2. Verify the test compiles but fails (expected)
3. Implement the minimum functionality to make the test pass
4. Verify implementation with `cargo check` and `cargo test`
5. Update documentation and project tracking files

## Single-File Focus

This session will focus exclusively on:
- File: src/processor.rs
- Functionality: ObjectId type handling in annotate_page function
- Requirements: Fix type issues while maintaining functionality

## Implementation Plan

I'll implement this fix in the following steps:

1. Examine the lopdf::ObjectId API to understand proper usage
2. Modify the annotate_page function to use correct ObjectId construction
3. Update all references to ObjectId throughout the file
4. Verify with `cargo check`
5. Run tests with `cargo test`
6. Update tracking documentation

## Error Recovery Strategy

If I encounter any errors:
1. I'll focus on fixing one error at a time
2. Document any API discrepancies in API_CORRECTIONS.md
3. Follow the compile-check cycle to verify each fix
4. Reset context if necessary by updating state files

## Context Management Plan

To maintain clear context throughout this session:
1. I'll focus only on the ObjectId type issues
2. Document progress after each significant step
3. Clearly mark completion of tasks in tracking files
4. Summarize the session results at the end

Let's begin implementation of the ObjectId type fix...
