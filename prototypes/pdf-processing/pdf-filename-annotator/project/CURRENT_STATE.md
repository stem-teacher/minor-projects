- **Last Successful Compilation**: ✅ All fixes compile successfully with `cargo check`
- **Last Test Run**: March 29, 2025 - All tests passing in test environment
- **Compile-Check Cycle**: ✅ Clean compilation
- **Functionality Status**: ✅ Core annotation feature works with simple PDFs and improved with scanner PDFs
- **Current Blockers**: No blocker issues - ready for real-world testing

## Implemented Solutions Summary

### Fixed Type Mismatches and Borrowing Issues
- Fixed page_id type mismatch in processor.rs
- Fixed array size mismatches
- Replaced drop(page_dict) with let _ = page_dict to properly end borrow scopes
- Fixed unused imports

### Added FreeText Annotations for Search Compatibility
- Created new add_text_annotation method in annotation.rs
- Implemented FreeText annotations based on Preview's approach
- Updated searchable_annotation implementation to use the new method
- Created proper annotation dictionaries with all required attributes

### Fixed Scanner PDF Issues
- Fixed processor.rs to maintain correct generation numbers with page IDs
- Improved content stream preservation for scanner PDFs
- Implemented proper resource dictionary merging
- Preserved XObject references in resource dictionaries

## Next Steps

### Task 3.3: Fix Scanned PDF Issues (Continue)
1. **Real-world Testing with Scanner PDFs:**
   - Test with variety of scanner-generated PDFs
   - Verify annotations appear on all pages
   - Test text extraction with pdftotext and other tools
   - Check compatibility with popular PDF readers

2. **Enhance Error Reporting:**
   - Add more detailed diagnostic information to page-level errors
   - Implement improved logging of PDF structure for failed pages
   - Create test cases to verify error handling

3. **Complete Comprehensive Testing:**
   - Expand test suite with more real-world scanner PDFs
   - Implement visual verification
   - Test across different PDF viewers
   - Develop performance metrics for large PDF batches

The complete implementation plan follows a phased approach that addresses each of the identified scanner PDF issues sequentially, with clear deliverables and success criteria for each phase.
