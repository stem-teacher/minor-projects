## Notes
- Each checkable item should have a clear, verifiable outcome
- All code changes must follow test-first methodology as outlined in [IMPLEMENTATION_METHODOLOGY.md](IMPLEMENTATION_METHODOLOGY.md)
- When a task is completed, update CURRENT_STATE.md with progress information
- For any discovered API discrepancies, update API_CORRECTIONS.md
- Issues identified in review/code_review.md should be addressed in Task 3.3
- Use AI code review with openai-reasoning model to verify approach before implementation
