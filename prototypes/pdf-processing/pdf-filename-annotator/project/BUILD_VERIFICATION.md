### Compilation Error Details
1. **ObjectId Type Mismatch**:
   ```
   error[E0308]: mismatched types
     --> src/processor.rs:94:25
      |
   94 |             let page_id = (*obj_id, *gen_num);
      |                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      |                            |
      |                            expected struct `ObjectId`, found tuple
      |                            help: try using a conversion method: `ObjectId::from((*obj_id, *gen_num))`
   ```

2. **Mutable Borrowing Conflict**:
   ```
   error[E0499]: cannot borrow `doc` as mutable more than once at a time
     --> src/processor.rs:194:29
      |
   185 |         let page_dict = doc.get_dictionary_mut(page_id)?;
      |                           --- first mutable borrow occurs here
   ...
   194 |                 let stream_id = doc.add_object(Object::Stream(stream_clone));
      |                                 ^^^ second mutable borrow occurs here
   ```

## Test Verification
```bash
# Commands run for testing
cargo test
```

### Results
- Tests Run: 2
- Passing: 1
- Failing: 1
- Ignored: 0

### Test Error Details
```
---- processor::tests::test_annotate_page stdout ----
thread 'processor::tests::test_annotate_page' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Processing("Invalid type for annotate_page")', src/processor.rs:350:10
```

## Build Performance
```bash
# Commands run for build (to be executed after fixes)
time cargo build
time cargo build --release
```

### Results
- Debug Build Time: N/A (build fails)
- Release Build Time: N/A (build fails)
- Debug Binary Size: N/A
- Release Binary Size: N/A

## Memory Testing
```bash
# Commands run for memory testing (pending successful build)
valgrind ./target/release/pdf-filename-annotator
```

### Results
- Memory Leaks: N/A (build fails)
- Memory Usage: N/A
- Issues Found: N/A

## API Compatibility
- Breaking Changes: No (still in development)
- API Additions: No
- API Removals: No

## Build Artifacts
- Debug Binary: N/A (build fails)
- Release Binary: N/A (build fails)
- Documentation: ./target/doc/pdf_filename_annotator/index.html (pending successful build)

## Recommendations
1. Fix ObjectId type issues in processor.rs by using proper ObjectId construction
2. Restructure content stream handling to avoid multiple mutable borrows
3. Update API_CORRECTIONS.md with proper lopdf API usage
4. Run comprehensive tests after fixes
5. Consider adding more unit tests for processor.rs

## Next Steps
1. Fix ObjectId type issues in processor.rs
2. Fix mutable borrowing conflicts in processor.rs
3. Run cargo check to verify fixes
4. Run cargo test to validate functionality
5. Update documentation and build verification report
