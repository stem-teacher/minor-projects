## STARTUP INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE CODE
When you see the command 'go', do the following:
1. Read ONLY the project/PRECISE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md file first
2. Locate the current active task from the implementation plan
3. Read the task-specific files in the corresponding task directory
4. Execute ONLY the instructions in the CLAUDE_CODE_TASK.md file for that task
5. DO NOT attempt to load the entire project structure
6. Document each file you access and each command you execute
7. Update the task logs with your results

## IMPORTANT NOTES FOR AGENTS
- Follow the structured SDLC process defined in project documentation
- Maintain a clear separation between orchestration (Claude Desktop) and execution (Claude Code)
- Use the templates provided in the process directory
- Document all actions in the appropriate log files
- Avoid loading unnecessary files to prevent context overflow
- Focus only on the current task as defined in the implementation plan
