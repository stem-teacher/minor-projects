# PDF Filename Annotator Fixes

This directory contains fixed versions of the files needed to address:
1. The front page of converted PDF documents is blank
2. There are no text annotations on any page except page one

## How to Apply

1. Back up your original files:
   ```
   cp src/processor.rs src/processor.rs.bak
   cp src/annotation.rs src/annotation.rs.bak
   ```

2. Replace with the fixed versions:
   ```
   cp fixed_files/processor.rs src/
   cp fixed_files/annotation.rs src/
   ```

3. Rebuild and test:
   ```
   cargo build --release
   ```

## Key Changes

1. Page ID handling - Using actual PDF object IDs instead of indices
2. Unified annotation approach - No special-casing by page number
3. Improved content stream handling - Works with all PDF structures
4. Fixed page tree structure - Ensures correct page tree relationships

These changes ensure that all pages get properly annotated, regardless of
their position in the document or the PDF's structure.
