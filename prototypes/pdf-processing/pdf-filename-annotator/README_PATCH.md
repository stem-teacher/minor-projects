# PDF Filename Annotator - Patch Instructions

This directory contains patches to fix two key issues in the PDF Filename Annotator:

1. The front page of converted PDF documents is blank
2. There are no text annotations on any page except page one

## Patch Overview

The patches are divided into small, focused changes:

1. `01_fix_page_ids.patch` - Fixes how page object IDs are handled to ensure we use the correct PDF page objects
2. `02_unified_annotation.patch` - Removes page-number-based special case handling that caused inconsistent annotation
3. `03_add_unified_page_annotation.patch` - Adds a unified annotation method that works for all page types
4. `04_fix_page_tree.patch` - Ensures the PDF page tree structure is properly maintained for all pages

## How to Apply the Patches

You can apply these patches using the standard `patch` command:

```bash
cd /path/to/pdf-filename-annotator
patch -p0 < patches/01_fix_page_ids.patch
patch -p0 < patches/02_unified_annotation.patch
patch -p0 < patches/03_add_unified_page_annotation.patch
patch -p0 < patches/04_fix_page_tree.patch
```

Alternatively, you can manually integrate the changes by examining each patch file and making the appropriate edits to the source files.

## Key Fixes

1. **Page ID Handling**: The original code was using page indices rather than actual PDF object IDs, causing issues with page identification.

2. **Unified Annotation Strategy**: Instead of special-casing pages based on their position (first page, pages 2-3, pages 4+), we now use a unified approach that:
   - Analyzes the content stream structure of each page
   - Applies the appropriate annotation strategy based on the detected structure
   - Handles array-based content streams correctly by appending new content

3. **Page Tree Structure**: The fixes include properly rebuilding the page tree structure to ensure all pages have correct parent pointers and are properly linked in the document structure.

After applying these patches, all pages should be properly annotated with the filename as specified.
