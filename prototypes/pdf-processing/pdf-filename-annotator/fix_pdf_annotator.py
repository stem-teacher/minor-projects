Here are the key changes needed to fix processor.rs:

1. Page ID Handling:
   - Use the actual page object IDs from doc.get_pages() 
   - Remove special handling based on page index

2. Unified Annotation Approach:
   - Create a unified_page_annotation function that works for all pages
   - Analyze content stream structure and apply appropriate strategy
   - Handle array-based content streams by appending new content

3. Fix Page Tree Structure:
   - Implement fix_page_tree to rebuild page tree when needed
   - Ensure all pages have correct parent pointers

Implement these changes to ensure annotations appear on all pages.

ANNOTATION_FIXES = """
Here are the key changes needed to fix annotation.rs:

1. Content Stream Handling:
   - Improve handling of different content stream structures
   - Fix add_text_to_page to work with all page types 
   - Ensure font resources are properly added to pages

2. Fix Resources Dictionary:
   - Ensure font resources exist in all pages
   - Properly handle resource dictionary references

These changes will fix the blank first page and missing annotations.

This directory contains fixed versions of the files needed to address:
1. The front page of converted PDF documents is blank
2. There are no text annotations on any page except page one

## How to Apply

1. Back up your original files:
   ```
   cp src/processor.rs src/processor.rs.bak
   cp src/annotation.rs src/annotation.rs.bak
   ```

2. Replace with the fixed versions:
   ```
   cp fixed_files/processor.rs src/
   cp fixed_files/annotation.rs src/
   ```

3. Rebuild and test:
   ```
   cargo build --release
   ```

## Key Changes

1. Page ID handling - Using actual PDF object IDs instead of indices
2. Unified annotation approach - No special-casing by page number
3. Improved content stream handling - Works with all PDF structures
4. Fixed page tree structure - Ensures correct page tree relationships

These changes ensure that all pages get properly annotated, regardless of
their position in the document or the PDF's structure.

    f.write("""# Implementation Plan for PDF Annotator Fixes

## Key Issues
1. The front page of converted PDF documents is blank
2. There are no text annotations on any page except page one

## Root Causes
1. Page references are handled incorrectly - using indices instead of actual PDF object IDs
2. Special-casing based on page numbers causes inconsistent behavior
3. Content stream handling is not robust for different PDF structures
4. Page tree structure may be invalid in some PDFs

## Fixes Required

### In processor.rs:
1. Fix how pages are iterated and processed:
   - Use doc.get_pages() object IDs directly
   - Remove special handling based on page number

2. Create a unified annotation approach:
   - Add unified_page_annotation method
   - Detect content stream type
   - Apply appropriate annotation strategy

3. Improve page tree handling:
   - Rebuild page tree when needed
   - Ensure all pages have correct parent pointers

### In annotation.rs:
1. Improve content stream handling:
   - Handle different content stream structures
   - Fix text annotation placement

2. Fix resources dictionary:
   - Ensure font resources exist on all pages
   - Handle resource dictionary references

## Implementation Steps
1. Fix processor.rs 
2. Fix annotation.rs
3. Test with various PDF types

## Testing Plan
Test with:
- Single page PDFs
- Multi-page PDFs
- Scanner-generated PDFs
- PDFs with different content stream structures
