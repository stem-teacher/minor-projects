# Task 2.3 Command Log: Implement cp-annotation CLI

## Directory and File Exploration

```bash
# Check for existing task directories
ls /Users/philiphaynes/devel/teaching/projects/minor-projects/prototypes/pdf-processing/pdf-filename-annotator/tasks

# Examine the Cargo.toml file
cat /Users/philiphaynes/devel/teaching/projects/minor-projects/prototypes/pdf-processing/pdf-filename-annotator/Cargo.toml
```

## Implementation

```bash
# Create cp_annotation.rs file
nano /Users/philiphaynes/devel/teaching/projects/minor-projects/prototypes/pdf-processing/pdf-filename-annotator/src/bin/cp_annotation.rs

# Update Cargo.toml to add the new binary
nano /Users/philiphaynes/devel/teaching/projects/minor-projects/prototypes/pdf-processing/pdf-filename-annotator/Cargo.toml
```

## Validation

```bash
# Format the code
cd /Users/philiphaynes/devel/teaching/projects/minor-projects/prototypes/pdf-processing && cargo fmt --package pdf-filename-annotator

# Check for compilation errors
cd /Users/philiphaynes/devel/teaching/projects/minor-projects/prototypes/pdf-processing && cargo check --package pdf-filename-annotator
```

## Summary of Changes

1. Created new binary file `src/bin/cp_annotation.rs` implementing the CLI tool to copy annotations between PDFs
2. Added new binary entry to Cargo.toml:
   ```toml
   [[bin]]
   name = "cp-annotation"
   path = "src/bin/cp_annotation.rs"
   ```
3. Formatted and verified code compiles successfully
