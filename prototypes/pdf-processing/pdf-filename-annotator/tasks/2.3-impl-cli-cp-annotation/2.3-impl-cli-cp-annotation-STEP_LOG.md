# Task 2.3 Step Log: Implement cp-annotation CLI

## Initial Setup
- Created task directory structure: `pdf-filename-annotator/tasks/2.3-impl-cli-cp-annotation`
- Created instructions file with detailed requirements

## Implementation Steps
1. Examined the current project structure
   - Reviewed existing Cargo.toml to understand the binary pattern
   - Verified that all required dependencies are available

2. Created the cp_annotation.rs file
   - Implemented the command-line interface with clap
   - Defined the Args struct with all necessary options
   - Implemented the core logic to:
     - Load source and target PDF documents
     - Process each annotation label
     - Find appropriate page numbers when target page is not specified
     - Call the recreate_annotation_by_label function
     - Handle errors gracefully with proper reporting
     - Save the modified document when successful

3. Updated Cargo.toml
   - Added new [[bin]] entry for cp-annotation
   - Ensured all required dependencies are included

4. Verified implementation
   - Ran cargo fmt to ensure code style consistency
   - Ran cargo check to confirm compilation without errors
   - Confirmed all specified functionality is implemented
