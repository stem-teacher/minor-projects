# Task 2.4.2 Execution Report

## Status: COMPLETED âœ…

The task to remove backup logic from the `set-annotation-value` tool has been successfully completed. The tool now correctly uses the `--in-place` flag to determine which file to save to, without creating any backup files.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated `Args` struct in `set_annotation_value.rs`**:
   - Removed the `--backup-suffix` argument entirely
   - Updated the help text for `--in-place` to clarify it modifies the input file without creating a backup

2. **Updated `main` function logic**:
   - Removed the entire block of code related to backup file creation
   - Kept the logic for determining the output path based on `in_place` flag
   - Removed the unused `std::fs` import

## Code Changes

```diff
// Removed backup_suffix argument and updated in_place help text
-    /// Modify the input file directly (creates backup)
+    /// Modify the input file directly (NO backup created by default)
     #[arg(long, default_value_t = false)]
     in_place: bool,
 
-    /// Suffix for backup file when using --in-place
-    #[arg(long, default_value = ".bak")]
-    backup_suffix: String,

// Removed backup creation logic
-    // Backup if in-place
-    if args.in_place {
-        let backup_path = args.input.with_extension(
-            args.input
-                .extension()
-                .unwrap_or_default()
-                .to_str()
-                .unwrap_or("")
-                .to_owned()
-                + &args.backup_suffix,
-        );
-        fs::copy(&args.input, &backup_path)
-            .with_context(|| format!("Failed to create backup file: {}", backup_path.display()))?;
-        println!("Created backup: {}", backup_path.display());
-    }
+    // Backup logic removed as per Task 2.4.2

// Removed unused import
-use std::fs;
```

## Verification

- Code formatting was applied using: `cargo fmt --package pdf-filename-annotator`
- Code compilation was verified using: `cargo check --package pdf-filename-annotator`
- No errors were reported related to the changes made

## Note

The task has been completed according to the requirements. The `--in-place` flag now only controls which file gets saved (input path vs output path) without creating any backup files. Backup management must now be handled by external scripts if needed.
