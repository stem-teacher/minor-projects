# Task 1.6.R1 Step Log - Implement add_labeled_rect

## Setup
- Created task directory: `pdf-filename-annotator/tasks/1.6.R1-lib-impl-add-rect`
- Created instructions file
- Created step log file (this file)
- Created command log file

## Implementation Steps

1. **Examined Existing Code**
   - Read the `annotation.rs` file to understand the existing functions and structure
   - Read the `lib.rs` file to understand what's exported
   - Read the `annotation_utils.rs` file to understand helper functions available
   - Read the `error.rs` file to understand error handling

2. **Added Helper Structs**
   - Added `Color` struct for RGB color representation (0.0 to 1.0 range)
   - Added `BorderStyle` struct for border style options (currently just width)

3. **Implemented `add_labeled_rect` Function**
   - Added function that creates Square annotations with a label
   - Implemented optional color, interior color, and border style parameters
   - Used existing annotation_utils functionality for adding to page

4. **Updated `lib.rs` Exports**
   - Added exports for new `add_labeled_rect` function
   - Added exports for new `Color` and `BorderStyle` structs

5. **Formatted and Checked Code**
   - Ran `cargo fmt --package pdf_exam_tools_lib`
   - Ran `cargo check --package pdf_exam_tools_lib`
   - Verified the implementation compiles successfully
