# Task 2.1.3 Step Log - Enhance add-annotation CLI for Rect Type

## Setup
- Created task directory: `pdf-filename-annotator/tasks/2.1.3-cli-add-rect-support`
- Created instructions file
- Created step log file (this file)
- Created command log file

## Implementation Steps

1. **Review Instructions** 
   - Read and analyzed the task instructions
   - Identified design mismatch between single-page `add_labeled_rect` and multi-page CLI
   
2. **Decision to Abort**
   - Based on the instructions, this task should be aborted
   - Need to implement `add_labeled_rect_multi` in the library first (as Task 1.6.1)
   - This will maintain consistency between library capabilities and CLI interface
   - Better to enhance the library first before updating the CLI tool
