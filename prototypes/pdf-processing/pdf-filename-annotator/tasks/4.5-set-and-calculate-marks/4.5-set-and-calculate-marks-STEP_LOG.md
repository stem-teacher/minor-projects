Project Root: /Users/philiphaynes/devel/teaching/projects/minor-projects/prototypes/pdf-processing
Goal: Set mark values, calculate totals for parts A and overall total.
Executing script: ./set-and-calculate-marks.sh

[Check] Verifying target file and binaries exist
Result: Prerequisites met.

[Action 1] Setting values for individual marks
  -> Created working copy at /Users/philiphaynes/devel/teaching/projects/minor-projects/prototypes/pdf-processing/test_resources/output/Y7SCID_smith_john-950786052_annotated.pdf.temp1
  -> Setting 'mark-q16-a' to '1'
     Successfully set value for 'mark-q16-a'.
  -> Setting 'mark-q16-b' to '2'
     Successfully set value for 'mark-q16-b'.
  -> Setting 'mark-q16-c' to '2'
     Successfully set value for 'mark-q16-c'.
  -> Setting 'mark-q16-d' to '1'
     Successfully set value for 'mark-q16-d'.
  -> Setting 'mark-q16-e' to '3'
     Successfully set value for 'mark-q16-e'.
  -> Setting 'mark-q16-f' to '2'
     Successfully set value for 'mark-q16-f'.
  -> Setting 'mark-q16-g' to '3'
     Successfully set value for 'mark-q16-g'.
  -> Setting 'mark-q16-h' to '1'
     Successfully set value for 'mark-q16-h'.
  -> Setting 'mark-q17' to '4'
     Successfully set value for 'mark-q17'.
  -> Setting 'mark-q18-a' to '2'
     Successfully set value for 'mark-q18-a'.
  -> Setting 'mark-q18-b' to '2'
     Successfully set value for 'mark-q18-b'.
  -> Setting 'mark-q19-a' to '2'
     Successfully set value for 'mark-q19-a'.
  -> Setting 'mark-q19-b' to '2'
     Successfully set value for 'mark-q19-b'.
  -> Setting 'mark-part-b' to '16'
     Successfully set value for 'mark-part-b'.
Result: All individual marks set successfully.

[Action 2] Calculating and setting mark-part-a (sum of individual question marks)
  -> Read value for 'mark-q16-a': 1 (Running total: 1)
  -> Read value for 'mark-q16-b': 2 (Running total: 3)
  -> Read value for 'mark-q16-c': 2 (Running total: 5)
  -> Read value for 'mark-q16-d': 1 (Running total: 6)
  -> Read value for 'mark-q16-e': 3 (Running total: 9)
  -> Read value for 'mark-q16-f': 2 (Running total: 11)
  -> Read value for 'mark-q16-g': 3 (Running total: 14)
  -> Read value for 'mark-q16-h': 1 (Running total: 15)
  -> Read value for 'mark-q17': 4 (Running total: 19)
  -> Read value for 'mark-q18-a': 2 (Running total: 21)
  -> Read value for 'mark-q18-b': 2 (Running total: 23)
  -> Read value for 'mark-q19-a': 2 (Running total: 25)
  -> Read value for 'mark-q19-b': 2 (Running total: 27)
  -> Setting 'mark-part-a' to '27'
Result: Successfully calculated and set mark-part-a to 27.

[Action 3] Calculating and setting mark-total (sum of part A and part B)
  -> Read value for 'mark-part-a': 27
  -> Read value for 'mark-part-b': 16
  -> Calculated total mark: 27 + 16 = 43
  -> Setting 'mark-total' to '43'
Result: Successfully calculated and set mark-total to 43.

## 2025-03-29 18:53 - Task 4.5-set-and-calculate-marks Result: SUCCESS
Validation: Successfully set all marks and calculated totals.
Summary:
  - Part A Total (Individual Questions): 27
  - Part B Total (Pre-defined): 16
