# Task 1.6.1 Step Log - Implement add_labeled_rect_multi

## Setup
- Created task directory: `pdf-filename-annotator/tasks/1.6.1-lib-impl-add-rect-multi`
- Created instructions file
- Created step log file (this file)
- Created command log file

## Implementation Steps

1. **Examined Existing Code**
   - Read the `annotation.rs` file to understand the existing functions and structure
   - Verified that `add_labeled_rect` is already implemented
   - Checked that `BorderStyle` already has the `Clone` trait
   - Examined `lib.rs` to understand current exports

2. **Implemented `add_labeled_rect_multi` Function**
   - Implemented the function based on the single-page version
   - Added page iteration with label templating
   - Included proper error handling with logging
   - Used the existing `add_labeled_rect` function with appropriate parameters

3. **Updated Exports in `lib.rs`**
   - Added `add_labeled_rect_multi` to the list of exports

4. **Formatted and Checked Code**
   - Ran `cargo fmt --package pdf_exam_tools_lib`
   - Ran `cargo check --package pdf_exam_tools_lib`
   - Verified the implementation compiles successfully
