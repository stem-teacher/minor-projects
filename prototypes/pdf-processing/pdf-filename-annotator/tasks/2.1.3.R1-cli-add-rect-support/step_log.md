# Task 2.1.3.R1 Step Log - Enhance add-annotation CLI for Rect Type

## Setup
- Created task directory: `pdf-filename-annotator/tasks/2.1.3.R1-cli-add-rect-support`
- Created instructions file
- Created step log file (this file)
- Created command log file

## Implementation Steps

1. **Examined Existing Code**
   - Read the `add_annotation.rs` file to understand the existing implementation
   - Verified that the file was already structured to handle the `type_` parameter, but only supported `freetext`

2. **Updated Imports**
   - Added imports for `add_labeled_rect_multi`, `Color`, and `BorderStyle` from `pdf_exam_tools_lib`

3. **Updated the `Args` struct**
   - Updated the command description to mention Rect/Square support
   - Updated the help text for the `type_` parameter to mention rect/square options
   - Added rectangle-specific arguments:
     - `color`: Optional border color
     - `interior_color`: Optional fill color
     - `border_width`: Optional border width
   - Organized the arguments into logical sections with comments

4. **Added `parse_color` Function**
   - Implemented a function to parse RGB color values from a comma-separated string
   - Added validation to ensure the colors are in the valid range (0.0 to 1.0)

5. **Updated the `main` Function**
   - Replaced the type check with a match statement to handle different annotation types
   - Implemented the "freetext" case to match the existing functionality
   - Added the "rect"/"square" case to call `add_labeled_rect_multi`
   - Added proper error handling for unsupported types
   - Updated the success message to include the annotation type

6. **Formatted and Checked Code**
   - Ran `cargo fmt --package pdf-filename-annotator`
   - Ran `cargo check --package pdf-filename-annotator`
   - Verified the implementation compiles successfully
