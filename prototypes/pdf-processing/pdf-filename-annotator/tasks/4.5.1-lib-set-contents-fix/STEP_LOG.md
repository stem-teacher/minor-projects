# Task 4.5.1 Step Log

## Setup
- Created task directory: `pdf-filename-annotator/tasks/4.5.1-lib-set-contents-fix`
- Created instructions file: `instructions.md`
- Created this step log file

## Steps Executed
1. **Locate Function:** Found the `set_annotation_contents` function in `pdf_exam_tools_lib/src/annotation_utils.rs`
2. **Modify Implementation:** Updated the function to remove `/RC` and `/AP` keys after setting the `/Contents` key
3. **Format and Check:** 
   - Ran `cargo fmt --package pdf_exam_tools_lib` - Completed successfully
   - Ran `cargo check --package pdf_exam_tools_lib` - Completed successfully with one warning about an unused import (unrelated to our changes)
4. **Additional Clean-up:** Removed the unused `Error as LopdfError` import
   - Verified with `cargo check` that the warning was resolved
5. **Create Execution Report**

## Results
The implementation was successfully modified to remove the `/RC` and `/AP` keys when setting annotation contents. This should force PDF viewers to use the `/Contents` value along with the `/DA` (Default Appearance) settings. The code was also cleaned up by removing an unused import.
