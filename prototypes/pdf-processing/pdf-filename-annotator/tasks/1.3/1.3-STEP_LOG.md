# 1.3-STEP_LOG.md

## 2025-03-26 - Task Created
- **Action**: Set up task documentation for creating a simple Rust hello world project
- **Result**: Successfully created task directory and initial documentation files
- **Observations**: The template-based approach works well for task setup
- **Decisions**: 
  - Will use clap for command-line argument parsing
  - Will implement customizable greeting formats
  - Will follow test-first methodology as outlined in IMPLEMENTATION_METHODOLOGY.md
- **Issues**: None so far
- **Next Steps**: 
  1. Complete the preparation phase
  2. Set up a new Rust project structure
  3. Create test cases and implementation
- **Context Usage**: Low (approximately 10% of context window)

## 2025-03-26 - Project Structure Setup
- **Action**: Created Rust project structure for hello world application
- **Result**: Basic project structure created with all necessary files
- **Observations**: The project structure follows standard Rust conventions with lib.rs and main.rs
- **Decisions**: 
  - Using a modular structure with separate library and CLI components
  - Added clap for command-line parsing
  - Implemented three greeting styles (Formal, Casual, Enthusiastic)
- **Issues**: None
- **Next Steps**: 
  1. The actual execution of this project must be handled by Claude Code
  2. Claude Code should run the tests and build process
  3. Results should be documented in the COMMAND_LOG.md
- **Context Usage**: Medium (approximately 35% of context window)

## 2025-03-26 - Implementation Note
- **Action**: Clarified execution requirements
- **Result**: Updated task documentation
- **Observations**: The actual code execution should be performed by Claude Code, not Claude Desktop
- **Decisions**: 
  - Claude Desktop will handle orchestration but not code execution
  - All build/test commands should be executed by Claude Code
  - Results will be properly logged in the task documentation
- **Issues**: None
- **Next Steps**: 
  1. Have Claude Code execute the project build and test process
  2. Document the results in COMMAND_LOG.md
  3. Complete the task cycle according to SDLC guidelines
- **Context Usage**: Medium (approximately 40% of context window)

## 2025-03-26 - Pre-Execution Update
- **Action**: Updated tasks documentation and context management instructions
- **Result**: Updated Claude Code instructions with context management guidance 
- **Observations**: The checklist did not accurately reflect the actual implementation progress
- **Decisions**: 
  - Updated 1.3-CHECKLIST.md to accurately reflect current implementation status
  - Added context management instructions for Claude Code to prevent context overflow
  - Clarified that Claude Code should only load files referenced by the implementation plan
- **Issues**: Task appeared less complete in documentation than in actual implementation
- **Next Steps**: 
  1. Have Claude Code execute the project build and test process with improved context management
  2. Document the results in COMMAND_LOG.md
  3. Complete the remaining checklist items after execution
- **Context Usage**: Medium (approximately 45% of context window)
