# 1.3-DESCRIPTION.md

## Task Information
- **Task ID**: 1.3
- **Type**: Implementation
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Assigned To**: Claude Desktop (orchestration) and Claude Code (execution)
- **Est. Completion Time**: 1 day

## Objectives
- Create a simple Rust "Hello World" application using the structured SDLC process
- Implement proper documentation following the new template structure
- Test the context management strategies with a simple, controlled project
- Demonstrate the AI collaboration protocol between Claude Desktop and Claude Code
- Verify the process addresses context window limitations effectively

## Success Metrics
- The project successfully compiles and runs with `cargo run` (executed by Claude Code)
- The application accepts a name parameter and displays a customized greeting
- All required documentation is created and maintained throughout development
- The development process is clearly logged with timestamps and context management notes
- The task is completed without any uncontrolled context resets
- Clear separation of roles between Claude Desktop (orchestration) and Claude Code (execution)

## Dependencies
- Rust toolchain installed and functioning
- Process templates and scripts created
- Task 1.1 and 1.2 completed (verification of existing code)
- Claude Code access for executing build and test commands

## Approach
1. Claude Desktop creates the task structure and documentation
2. Claude Desktop sets up the Rust project structure and files
3. Claude Code executes the build and test process
4. Claude Desktop documents results and maintains project tracking
5. Both AIs follow the structured SDLC templates throughout the process

## Context Reset Information
- **Last Update**: 2025-03-26 
- **Current Focus**: Task setup and project structure creation
- **Token Usage**: Medium
- **Critical Path**: Project structure is set up; Claude Code needs to execute the build and test process
