# Task 1.9 Execution Log

## Actions Taken

1. Created task directory: `/Users/philiphaynes/devel/teaching/projects/minor-projects/prototypes/pdf-processing/pdf-filename-annotator/tasks/1.9-lib-impl-get-properties`
2. Created instructions file: `instructions.md`
3. Created execution log file: `execution_log.md`
4. Updated `annotation_utils.rs`:
   - Added imports for `serde::Serialize`
   - Added `AnnotationProperties` struct with all required fields
   - Implemented helper functions `extract_color_property` and `extract_border_style_property` (which were missing from Task 1.8.2)
   - Implemented `get_annotation_properties` function to find and extract details from labeled annotations
5. Updated `annotation.rs`:
   - Added `serde::Serialize` derive to the `Color` struct
   - Added `serde::Serialize` derive to the `BorderStyle` struct
6. Updated `lib.rs` to export the new function and struct:
   - Added `pub use annotation_utils::{get_annotation_properties, AnnotationProperties};`
7. Resolved compilation issues:
   - Removed unused imports
   - Fixed method call from `as_name_str()` to use `as_name()` with proper string conversion
   - Added serialization support to the required structs

## Validation

1. Ran `cargo fmt --package pdf_exam_tools_lib` to format the code
2. Ran `cargo check --package pdf_exam_tools_lib` to verify compilation
   - All issues have been resolved, code compiles successfully

## Note on Task 1.8.2

The instructions referenced helper functions from Task 1.8.2, but this task directory was not found in the project. I had to implement the helper functions from scratch based on the function signatures and the existing code in the project:

1. `extract_color_property`: Extracts color values from /C or /IC properties of annotation dictionaries
2. `extract_border_style_property`: Extracts border style information from either /BS or /Border properties

## Summary

The task has been successfully completed. The new `get_annotation_properties` function allows retrieval of a structured summary of a labeled annotation's properties, which will be valuable for debugging and verification purposes. The implementation integrates well with the existing codebase and follows the same error handling patterns used throughout the project.
