# Directory Restructuring Summary Report

## Overview
- **Date:** March 27, 2025
- **Purpose:** Reorganize directories to make annotated PDFs the primary files
- **Original Directory (Now):** `/Volumes/second-store/scan/2025-T1-orig/`
- **New Directory (With Annotated Files):** `/Volumes/second-store/scan/2025-T1/`

## Actions Performed
1. **Directory Renaming:**
   - Original `/Volumes/second-store/scan/2025-T1` → `/Volumes/second-store/scan/2025-T1-orig`
   - Annotated `/Volumes/second-store/scan/2025-T1-annotated` → `/Volumes/second-store/scan/2025-T1`

2. **Non-PDF File Transfer:**
   - Copied all non-PDF files from original directory structure to new structure
   - Preserved file attributes and permissions
   - Total of 18 non-PDF files copied across all class directories

## Per-Class Summary

| Class | PDF Files | Non-PDF Files | Non-PDF Files Copied |
|-------|-----------|---------------|----------------------|
| 7SCID | 30        | 3             | 7SCID-Summary.pdf.to-rename-back, 7SCID-class-list.json, rename_files.sh |
| 7SCIF | 29        | 3             | 7SCIF-class-list.json, missing.txt, rename-files.sh |
| 7SCIG | 30        | 4             | .DS_Store, 7SCIG-class-list.json, missing.txt, rename_files.sh |
| 7SCIO | 30        | 2             | 7SCIO-class-list.json, rename-files.sh |
| 7SCIR | 30        | 3             | 7SCIR-class-list.json, missing.txt, rename-files.sh |
| 7SCIS | 29        | 3             | 7SCIS-class-list.json, missing.txt, rename-files.sh |
| **Total** | **178** | **18** | |

## Verification Results
- All directories renamed successfully
- All PDF files verified in new structure (178 total)
- All non-PDF files copied successfully (18 total)
- File counts match between original and new directories for both PDF and non-PDF files

## Current Status
- The annotated PDF files are now available in the primary directory path (`/Volumes/second-store/scan/2025-T1/`)
- Original files preserved in backup directory (`/Volumes/second-store/scan/2025-T1-orig/`)
- All auxiliary files (scripts, class lists, etc.) preserved in the new structure
