## Session: 2025-03-26 - Initial Process Implementation

### Session Goals
- Implement structured SDLC process framework
- Create templates and guidelines
- Set up Task 1.3 as a test case
- Establish agent-specific context tracking

### Key Activities
1. Created process directory with templates:
   - TASK_DESCRIPTION_TEMPLATE.md
   - TASK_CHECKLIST_TEMPLATE.md
   - TASK_STEP_LOG_TEMPLATE.md
   - TASK_COMMAND_LOG_TEMPLATE.md
   - TASK_SUMMARY_TEMPLATE.md

2. Created process guidelines:
   - CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md
   - AI_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md

3. Created create_task.sh script for task setup

4. Added Task 1.3 to implementation plan and checklist

5. Created Task 1.3 documentation and hello world project structure:
   - Set up in tasks/1.3 directory
   - Created hello world Rust project
   - Implemented greeting functionality with multiple styles
   - Added tests for all greeting styles

6. Established agent-specific context tracking:
   - Created agents/claude_desktop directory
   - Created CLAUDE_DESKTOP.md for context restoration
   - Created TASK_TRACKING.md for agent-specific tasks
   - Created SESSION_LOG.md for session continuity
   - Created agents/claude_code directory for Claude Code context

### Decisions Made
- Implemented clear separation of roles:
  - Claude Desktop handles orchestration
  - Claude Code handles execution
- Created templates to standardize task documentation
- Added agent-specific context tracking for session continuity
- Established process for controlled context resets
- Created dedicated tasks directory for organizing task files

### Issues Encountered
- Initially created task directory at root level, then relocated to tasks directory
- Made sure to update all references to the task location in context files

### Next Session Goals
1. Complete Task 1.3 with Claude Code execution
2. Validate structured process effectiveness
3. Apply process to Task 3.3 (Fix Scanned PDF Issues)
4. Refine templates and guidelines based on experience

### Context Reset Note
To continue this work in a future session, start by reviewing:
1. `/agents/claude_desktop/CLAUDE_DESKTOP.md`
2. `/agents/claude_desktop/TASK_TRACKING.md`
3. `/agents/claude_desktop/SESSION_LOG.md`

These files contain the necessary context to restore the conversation flow.
