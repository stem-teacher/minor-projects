# Claude Desktop Session Context

## Current Session Information
- **Last Updated**: 2025-03-26
- **Session Status**: Completed
- **Current Focus**: Implementing structured SDLC process
- **Active Task**: Task 1.3 - Create Structured SDLC Test Project

## Project Overview
The PDF Filename Annotator is a Rust application designed to process PDF files by stamping each page with its filename in the top-right corner. The project has made significant progress with core functionality, but faces challenges with scanner PDF handling and needs a more structured development process.

## Current State
- Created structured SDLC framework with templates and guidelines
- Set up Task 1.3 as a test for the structured process
- Established clear roles for Claude Desktop and Claude Code
- Prepared a hello world Rust project as a test case
- Implemented agent-specific context tracking for session continuity
- Organized task files in dedicated tasks directory

## Active Tasks
1. **Process Implementation**:
   - [x] Create process templates
   - [x] Create process guidelines
   - [x] Create task creation script
   - [x] Create agent-specific context tracking
   
2. **Task 1.3 Implementation**:
   - [x] Add Task 1.3 to implementation plan
   - [x] Update project checklist
   - [x] Create Task 1.3 documentation
   - [x] Set up hello world project structure
   - [ ] Have Claude Code execute build and test process
   - [ ] Verify process effectiveness

## Next Actions
1. Have Claude Code execute the build and test process for Task 1.3
   - Added context management instructions to prevent context overflow
   - Updated task documentation to reflect actual implementation progress
   - Ensured Claude Code will properly document file access and command execution
2. Review the results and document in task logs
3. Complete Task 1.3 and create a task summary
4. **NEW TASK**: Create Process for Consistent Application Validation
   - Develop structured validation methodology for testing PDF annotations
   - Create standardized testing scripts and procedures
   - Establish consistent file organization strategy
   - Document the validation process with clear steps
5. **NEW TASK**: Re-implement Subtask 3.3.3 (Consistent Annotation Strategy)
   - Apply the new validation process to verify annotation strategies
   - Implement per design goals with proper testing
   - Create comprehensive tests for different PDF types
   - Document the implementation with clear explanations
6. Apply the structured process to Task 3.3 (Fix Scanned PDF Issues)
7. Refine templates and guidelines based on experience with Task 1.3

## Context Restoration Instructions
When starting a new session:
1. Review this CLAUDE_DESKTOP.md file
2. Check the status of active tasks in project/CHECKLIST.md
3. Review the current state of Task 1.3 in tasks/1.3/1.3-STEP_LOG.md
4. Check SESSION_LOG.md for history of previous sessions
5. Continue from the "Next Actions" section above

## Key Project Files
- `/process/` - Templates and guidelines for structured SDLC
- `/project/PRECISE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Overall project plan
- `/project/CHECKLIST.md` - Project-wide task tracking
- `/tasks/1.3/` - Task 1.3 documentation and hello world project
- `/agents/` - Agent-specific context tracking
  - `/agents/claude_desktop/` - Claude Desktop context files
  - `/agents/claude_code/` - Claude Code context files

## Recent Decisions
- Established clear separation of responsibilities between Claude Desktop (orchestration) and Claude Code (execution)
- Created agent-specific context tracking to manage continuity across sessions
- Implemented standardized documentation templates for all tasks
- Added context management strategies to address token window limitations
- Organized session logs to maintain history across multiple interactions
- Moved task files to dedicated tasks directory for better organization

## Notes for Future Sessions
- Update this file at the end of each session with current status
- Document any context-related issues encountered
- Track effectiveness of the structured process
- Note any improvements needed for templates or guidelines
- Ensure all task handoffs between agents are clearly documented
