# Claude Desktop Session Context

## Current Session Information
- **Last Updated**: 2025-03-27
- **Session Status**: In Progress
- **Current Focus**: Font Consistency Fix and Next Task Planning
- **Active Task**: Font Inconsistency Fix (completed) and preparing for Task 5.1

## Project Overview
The PDF Filename Annotator is a Rust application designed to process PDF files by stamping each page with its filename in the top-right corner. The project has made significant progress with core functionality, but faces challenges with scanner PDF handling and needs a more structured development process.

## Current State
- Fixed font inconsistency issue by standardizing DA string format and font resources
- Cleaned up project structure by removing redundant files and directories
- Merged font fix changes from fix-font-inconsistency branch to main
- Added diagnostics tool to analyze PDF annotations
- Established structured SDLC framework and development processes

## Active Tasks
1. **Font Inconsistency Fix**:
   - [x] Fix DA string format to ensure consistency
   - [x] Add Name property to font dictionaries
   - [x] Ensure consistent font resources across pages
   - [x] Create diagnostic tool for analyzing PDF annotations
   - [x] Merge changes to main branch
   
2. **Next Task Preparation**:
   - [ ] Set up Task 5.1 (Create Process for Consistent Application Validation)
   - [ ] Create task documentation
   - [ ] Establish validation methodology for PDF annotations
   - [ ] Develop standardized testing scripts

## Next Actions
1. **Task 5.1**: Create Process for Consistent Application Validation
   - Develop structured validation methodology for testing PDF annotations
   - Create standardized testing scripts and procedures
   - Establish consistent file organization strategy
   - Document the validation process with clear steps
   - Implement automated verification tools
   - Create templates for validation reports

2. **Task 5.2**: Re-implement Subtask 3.3.3 (Consistent Annotation Strategy)
   - Apply the new validation process to verify annotation strategies
   - Implement per design goals with proper testing
   - Create comprehensive tests for different PDF types
   - Document the implementation with clear explanations

3. Apply the structured process to Task 3.3 (Fix Scanned PDF Issues)
   - Use the validation process to identify and fix remaining issues
   - Address the annotation strategy inconsistencies
   - Ensure all scanned PDFs are properly processed

## Context Restoration Instructions
When starting a new session:
1. Review this CLAUDE_DESKTOP.md file
2. Check the status of active tasks in project/CHECKLIST.md
3. Check SESSION_LOG.md for history of previous sessions
4. Continue from the "Next Actions" section above

## Key Project Files
- `/process/` - Templates and guidelines for structured SDLC
- `/project/PRECISE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Overall project plan
- `/project/CHECKLIST.md` - Project-wide task tracking
- `/src/bin/analyze_pdf_annotations.rs` - New tool for diagnosing PDF annotation issues
- `/agents/` - Agent-specific context tracking
  - `/agents/claude_desktop/` - Claude Desktop context files
  - `/agents/claude_code/` - Claude Code context files

## Recent Decisions
- Fixed font inconsistency by standardizing DA string format and font resources
- Added detailed logging to help diagnose PDF annotation issues
- Created a dedicated analyzer tool for examining PDF annotations
- Cleaned up project structure by removing redundant files
- Merged font fix changes to the main branch
- Prioritized Task 5.1 (Consistent Application Validation) as the next task

## Notes for Future Sessions
- Update this file at the end of each session with current status
- Document any context-related issues encountered
- Track effectiveness of the structured process
- Note any improvements needed for templates or guidelines
- Ensure all task handoffs between agents are clearly documented
