# Claude Code Session Context

## Current Session Information
- **Last Updated**: 2025-03-26
- **Session Status**: Pending
- **Current Focus**: Building and testing hello world project
- **Active Task**: Task 1.3 - Create Structured SDLC Test Project

## Execution Role
Claude Code is responsible for the actual execution of code-related tasks, including:
- Running build commands
- Executing tests
- Implementing code modifications
- Debugging issues
- Documenting command outputs

## Current Assignment
See `/tasks/1.3/CLAUDE_CODE_TASK.md` for the detailed task description.

### Task Summary
Build and test the hello world Rust project:
1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Run `cargo check` to verify the code compiles
3. Run `cargo test --lib` to run the unit tests
4. Run `cargo build` to build the project
5. Run `cargo test` to run all tests including integration tests
6. Run the application with various arguments to verify functionality
7. Document all commands and their outputs in 1.3-COMMAND_LOG.md

## Next Actions
1. Execute the build and test process for the hello world project
2. Document all commands and outputs
3. Report any issues encountered

## Context Management
To avoid overwhelming the context window:
1. When you see the command 'go', first read ONLY the `/project/PRECISE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` file
2. ONLY load and act upon files that are explicitly referenced in this plan
3. DO NOT load the entire project directory structure
4. Focus specifically on the task assigned (e.g., Task 1.3)
5. Prioritize loading small, focused files over large files
6. Document which files you read in your response

## Context Restoration Instructions
When starting a new session:
1. Review this CLAUDE_CODE.md file
2. Read the task description in tasks/1.3/CLAUDE_CODE_TASK.md
3. Check the current state of the project in tasks/1.3/hello_world
4. Continue from the "Next Actions" section above

## Project Files
- `/tasks/1.3/hello_world/` - Rust project to build and test
- `/tasks/1.3/CLAUDE_CODE_TASK.md` - Detailed task instructions
- `/tasks/1.3/1.3-COMMAND_LOG.md` - Where to log command outputs
